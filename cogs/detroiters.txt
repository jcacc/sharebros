A million dollars?  Heck yeah, we got a deal.
Carter?  Carter Grant, VP of marketing, Chrysler?  Uh, yeah.

Tim Cramblin, Cramblin Advertising.
Hello, Tim.
Cramblin Advertising?  Are you Hank Cramblin's son?  That I am, yeah.
You know Sally Pomerantz?  Head of creative for Pomerantz and Klein.
Hank Cramblin, what a legend.
How is your father?  He went insane.
He lives in a nuthouse now.
Oh.
Well, the next time you see him,  you tell him Sally Pomerantz from Chicago said hello.
He won't understand that.
Talking to him is like talking to Bugs Bunny.
Well, then you tell him, "What's up, doc?"  Thank you.
That'll mean a lot to him.
Sally Pomerantz.
Just as lovely  as I'd always imagined.
I mean, wrong color but  just as lovely.
Yeah, he imagines everyone black.
I suppose it's because I'm black.
- Oh, that could be.
- Could be.
- That could - Could  Both: Be.
Carter, we are on our way out  because we already ate here.
Look at these stains on our ties.
Look at the receipt.
I'm guessing all the agencies are in town  because you're hearing pitches for your new campaign.
Well, Cramblin would love  to throw our hat in the ring on that.
Oh.
Well, have I seen your work?  Oh, you sure have.
Delta Airlines, Budweiser  No, no, no.
Not your father's.

- That's us!  No, it's, uh  That's a very catchy tune, yeah.
But, you know, I'm just not sure that your firm  is what we're looking for right now, gentlemen.
Oh, sure, 'cause you're probably gonna go  with these fine folks from Chicago  'cause that's where you make your cars.
Wait a minute.
No, you don't.
Where do they make their cars, Sam?  Right here in Detroit.
Come on, Carter.
You make your cars here.
Make your ads here.
[Chuckles softly.]
Fellas, it took a lot of balls coming in here like this.
Well, we were already eating here, so  Receipt, so  Right, the receipt, yeah.
Um  Tell you what.
Why don't you come by tomorrow?  Hmm? 8:00.

Oh, I was so scared in there.
I know you were.
You were great, though.

I'm right here, buddy.
Okay, Chrysler.
Chrysler.
You'll love the visor in your brand-new Chrysler.
If I don't get a Chrysler,  I'm gonna cry, sir.
Jesus Chrysler!  What a car!  I'm taking off for the day,  unless there's anything you need,  anything at all, big Hank.
Ms.
Portnadi, Hank was my father.
I'm Tim, remember?  Whoops.
I dropped my pencil.
[Sultry music.]
[Panting.]
Can I just leave it there?  - Yes, please.
- For the love of god, do.
- Yes.
- Night, Sheila.
Okay, Chrysler.
Chrysler.
You guys ready to edit the hot tub commercial?  Lea, that's small potatoes.
We're working on a big old potato.
You can go ahead and do it yourself.
You sure?  Lea, you're in film school.
I think you can edit  a hot tub commercial by yourself.
Thanks, guys.
I will not let you down.
Uh  All right, let's stop screwing around.
It's 12 hours till the pitch.
Be nicer.
Drive a Chrysler.
[Ball thuds.]
- You suck.
- No, you suck.
You got nothing.
- You got nothing.
- I everything.
You got nothing.
[Rock music.]
[Bleep.]
!    - Foul! - That's on me!  You're maybe thinking   about being the better man   - Foul! -  But you're still young   you don't want to take that step   you can't run, you can't lie, you can't hide   Oh, travel! Oh, travel!  [Elbow thunks.]
[Groans.]
- Whoa! - Whoa.
I can't believe that didn't break the window.
I know.
It's almost like it's unbreakable.
[Funky music.]
- Stapler.
- Stapler.
[Yells.]
- Oh! - Oh! Oh!  - [Chuckling.]
- Oh, my god!  Oh, man!  Ninja throw!  [Chuckling.]
Wow, didn't even.
It didn't even.
Both: Coffeepot! Coffeepot!  Coffeepot!  Go! [Yells.]
- Oh! - Yes!  Hello! Who is it?    [Yells.]
[Grunts and laughs.]
[Grunts.]
Candleholder!  Candleholder!  - Candleholder.
- Candleholder!  - Candleholder.
- Candleholder!  - Candleholder.
- [Grunts.]
- [Glass shatters.]
- Both: Oh!  Oh!  So it did break.
It didn't break.
It shattered.
One  Both: Two    [Desk clattering.]
Whoa.
Oh!  - Old diet pills.
- [Pills rattle.]
These things were basically speed.
Huh.
Expired January 1974.
You think it's safe to take some of those?  I don't know.
[Intense music.]
How about this?  Open on dad driving through the rain  in a brand-new Chrysler 300.
Across town, his daughter walks into a tattoo parlor.
Hands a pile of cash to the man at the counter.
Biker-type dude, like, a real mean guy,  like, a neo-nazi.
Yeah, she points to the sign  that says "nipple piercing,"  takes off her shirt, pulls down her bra.
We see everything.
Yes.
Cut to  Dad races across town.
Close-up.
Biker's meaty, hairy hand  grabs the daughter's nipple.
Pulls it out as far as it'll go.
Oh, it's farther than you think.
Yeah, it's way farther, man.
Biker pierces the nipple.
Daughter moans.
Drop of red blood rolls down her milky black breast.
- No, milky white breast.
- I pictured black.
- Keep going.
- In the reflection,  the drop of blood rolling down the daughter's breast,  we see the father standing in the window.
He sighs.
He smiles.
Says, "my baby's all growed up.
"  "Got to let her fly.
"  Chrysler.
Time to fly.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes!  Yes!  You know, the more I think about it,  I don't think we can show a boob in a commercial.
No.
No, we can't.
They wouldn't let us air  that nursing home commercial with a boob in it.
And that was just an accident.
Hey, Judy? Two more beers.
You got it.
Two beers.
Hot or cold?  Well, cold.
Come on, man.
[Soft music playing.]
Oh, it's time for Eddie's commercial.
Uh, Judy, can you turn on the TV?  Sure.
And that's one murder that had a happy ending.
We'll be right back with sports and weather after this.
Hi, folks, it's me, Eddie Champagne,  the hot tub king of Detroit.
[In slow motion.]
The hot tub king of  The hot tub king of Detroit.
Oh No.
And all the king's horses and all the king's men  couldn't put Eddie together again.
[Somber music.]
Oh!  Did he just eat that off the ground?  Ew! What did Lea do?  This is not the commercial.
My god, you're beautiful.
You really knock me out, you know that?  [Sparse piano music.]
You wouldn't want to  ever kiss a guy like me, would you?  No.
Probably got a boyfriend.
He's young and Virile.
I must disgust you.
Wish I would have met you when I was 18.
I was amazing then.
Eddie Champagne, the hot tub king of Detroit.
[Applause.]
Wow.
[Laughs.]
Normally I don't comment on the commercials,  but that was very bad.
- Oh, we're in trouble.
- [Cell phone buzzing.]
Looks like rain is headed our way, but  Let's get out of here.
- Thank you, Judy.
- Thanks, Judy.
You want a doggie bag for your beers?  - What are you talking about? - That's a dumb idea.
[Smooth rock music.]
We're dead.
Eddie's gonna kill us,  and we have got nothing on this Chrysler pitch.
We'll come up with something.
No, we won't, man.
We're dumb.
Hey.
Hey.
You remember when we first took over your dad's company  and everybody quit and all the clients left  all in the same day?  Yeah, of course I remember.
Well, you remember, like, a year later,  we got our first client?  Sure, Stan from the carpet store.
Yeah, what'd he want to call himself?  [Chuckles.]
What'd he want to call himself?  Big Stan the Carpet Guy.
What did we call him?  Big Stan the Carpet Man.
That's right, and why?  'Cause it rhymed.
'Cause it rhymed.
Yes.
See, buddy? We did it then.
We'll do it  - Now.
- Again, buddy.
It's 'cause it rhymes with "then.
"  It's got to rhyme for it to work.
That's the whole point of it.
- Oh, here come the trucks! - Here we go!  Here come the big rigs!  - Here we go, big Steve.
- Go get 'em, pal!  [Horn honks.]
Whoo! Thataway, Clint!  You the man, Steve!  Oh, happy birthday!  [Horn honks.]
Big Lou!  Lou!  - Oh, and wolf man.
- Oh, wolf man!  [All howling.]
[Horn honking.]
Yeah, I know it's a long shot,  but I really want to nail this Chrysler pitch.
I know.
We will, pal.
Yeah, not just for us.
For everyone, for the whole city.
[Horn honks.]
Go, Kathy.
Norman Drummond!  I mean, Chrysler isn't just a company.
It's it's these guys.
It's our friends.
It's our family.
Yeah, every Chrysler  is the city of Detroit on four wheels.
[Chuckles.]
That's it.
That's the pitch.
That's the pitch.
We got the pitch.
We got the pitch, buddy.
- We got the pitch! - We got the pitch!  - We got the pitch! - [Horn honks.]
[Upbeat music.]
And that's why every Chrysler  is like the city of Detroit on four wheels.
- On four wheels.
- On four wheels.
Yes.
Gentlemen.
Your morning hot dogs arrived.
Thank you, Sheila.
Knock 'em dead, big Hank.
I don't [Sighs.]
Well, there she is.
As I live and breathe.
Hey, did you guys like the commercial?  - No! - No, Lea, you tanked it.
- You shit the bed.
- Absolutely blew it.
- You blew it! - And it sucked!    Here we go.
You ready?  Sure I am.
We did it, pal.
We sure did.
I paid for the coffee, I picked up the dog,  and I told the cop I was with animal control, undercover.
[Laughs.]
Oh!  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Let's get the hell out of here - Uh-uh.
Let's dump his body in the woods  and walk in there like nothing happened.
What if he wakes up and sees us?  [Crunches.]
[Rock music.]
- Leave the bag out.
- Yeah.
It'll just be like a piece of bag out there.
Nobody's gonna ask anything.
No, I know.
He's not answering.
I'm so sorry.
He has never missed a meeting like this.
It's fine.
Just very unprofessional.
Let me call his cell phone.
Call his cell phone?  What are you gonna call it?  What?  You have to do stand-up.
I will, I promise.
That's weird.
Someone's coming out of the woods  with a bag of chips on their head.
You know, that is weird.
[People murmuring.]
- That's Carter Grant! - Oh, my god!  Did you see that guy?  - [People gasp.]
- Is he dead?  - Call 911! - Hold his head! Hold his head!  Over there!  [Laughter.]
I still have that dog.
- Oh! - [Laughs.]
Hey, Carter.
- Hey.
- Hey!  Remember us?  Like, when's the last time  you remember seeing us?  At at the steak house.
Yes, because that's the last place we saw you.
- Great.
- We we just  We brought you these.
Oh.
Thank you.
- We just want to say - Yeah.
You know, get well.
- Feel better.
- Thanks.
And, uh, also, you know,  we've got a great pitch for you,  when you're ready to hear it.
Ah.
I'm sorry, guys.
I really appreciate you coming down here,  but, um, we ended up going with Pomerantz and Klein.
What?  Why didn't you wait until you heard our pitch?  Honestly, I only scheduled that meeting  out of respect for your father.
Well, we'd still love for you to hear the pitch.
Who knows? You may reconsider.
Well, fellas, with all due respect,  you do late-night commercials for furniture stores.
Don't you think Chrysler's a little bit out of your league?  - You know? - [Laughter.]
Excuse me?  Out of our league?  - Oh, man! - Well, yeah, right?  Now you're definitely gonna hear the pitch.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are gonna hear the pitch.
We worked the pitch, and you're gonna hear it.
You're not gonna pitch to me in a hospital!  - Uh-huh.
- Open on  Both: Joe Louis's fist.
- Mm-mm.
No, no, no, no, no.
- We see an auto worker  driving through town, looking at the sights he knows.
The people, the places.
- His friends, his dad.
- I'm not listening.
- Mm-mm.
- No, you know what?  He's not listening.
He doesn't want to hear it.
Very well, I'm pulling the plug on your ass.
- Do it! Kill him! - Wait!  - Say good night, pal! - Bye!  I'm not on life support, you idiot!  - Why idiot? - Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay? [Stammering.]
Let's just all calm down here a little bit, okay?  - I'm sorry.
- Okay, we're all sorry.
Best of luck, guys.
It's nothing personal.
It's just business.
- It's just business.
- We understand.
Just business.
Okay?  And this is e-business we're in.
- Yes.
For sure.
- Yes.
Every Chrysler is like the city of Detroit  - on four wheels.
- Come on, man.
And this is the top, top  of the bottom line.
Now, this one  This one's a three-seater.
It's not virgin plastic,  so it's made from other stuff.
This could be a bottle  Can you excuse me for one second?  Eddie, we are so sorry.
Boys, I got to tell you, when that commercial aired,  wife and I went at it pretty bad.
I mean, I had my bags packed.
I was out the door.
And we decided, you know,  "let's just make love one last time.
"  For the first time ever,  we tried woman on top.
It was amazing.
Then we tried it again,  woman on top.
Wasn't a fluke.
I was able to last longer.
It was like I was able to stall  while she got what she needed.
And then, when she was done,  I flipped her over, and I went real fast,  so I got what I needed.
That's great, Eddie.
Very cool, very cool.
Spent the rest of the night in the hot tub,  just laughing and talking.
I found out her favorite show is "Scandal.
"  I didn't know that.
I love "Scandal.
"  Oh!  That night, I remembered  I was married to my best friend.
We thought you were gonna be mad.
Mad?  Your commercial saved my marriage.
[Bright music.]
- Great.
- Thanks, guys.
I'd stare the devil down for you   never make another sound unless you want me to   I'd turn my world around for you   just to hold you so gently   I'd bite back every frown for you   play the fool in front of all the town for you   rob a rightful king of his crown   and gladly pay the penalty   what I'd do for you   Hey, babe.
Hey, hon.
How was your day?  You won't even believe what happened.
A truck axle fell on the assembly line  and pinned Fred to the ground.
Oh, man, what did Tony do?  - Well, you know Tony.
- Yeah.
He just ran around  like a chicken with his dick cut off.
Classic Tony.
I had to lift the dang thing up myself  so little Joey could come drag him out from under it.
You wore your hernia belt, right?  You worry too much.
I worry about you.
Baby.
You coming upstairs?  I sure am.
They can just wait in line   what I'd do for you   I'd pay the price, the sacrifice   just to see it through   stand through all the storm and strife   what I'd do for you   every day, I'd yell   Sam!  Sam!  You can put me through hell   Sammy!  What's up, bud?  Just wanted to say great work today, pal.
- Thanks.
- You too, buddy.
You talking to my brother?  Mm-hmm.
How's flipping that house going, you idiot?  You're the idiot, Chrissy.
I bought this house for $20,000.
And it's a lot harder than I thought.
Sorry-ass.
Man, shut up, dummy.
- Good night.
- Night, buddy.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
Who even cares?  What I'd do for you   I'd do anything for you   Yes, I will, darling   Just to see it through   stand through the storm   - Candleholder! - Candleholder!  - Candleholder! - Candleholder!  - [Grunts.]
- Oh!  Candleholder.
- So it does break.
- [Laughter.]
- It does break.
- So it does break.

--- S01E02 ---
1 So then the guy comes in the store  soaking wet, looks straight to camera  and goes, "Um, I'd like to buy a kayak.
"  Moosehead Sports: You'll be up a creek with a paddle.
[Laughs.]
[Both laughing.]
Really, really funny.
Do not change a freaking word, you hear me?  So Sebastian, when do you want to shoot this puppy?  We can be ready by "mondee.
"  Oh, no, no, no can do, fellas.
I am walking out that door and I'm headed to Dubai  for a week of sand surfing.
- A week? - Yeah.
What about work?  Exactly.
What about it?  See, gentlemen, I have seven stores  that are doing what? Gangbusters.
Now, I could worry over every little detail  and die behind a desk from a bullet to the temple  like my daddy did,  but I prefer to delegate like my mommy did.
Little piece of advice for you, fellas.
Don't let making a living interfere with making a life.
[Dramatic music.]
[Inaudible.]
Fellas.
I got to go.
Well, Sebastian, enjoy Dubai.
Oh, it's going to be impossible not to.
Now it looks like you guys  could stand a little vacation yourselves.
I mean, look how tired Tim looks.
Oh, uh, that's just the shape of my face, sir.
No, I mean those huge black circles under your eyes.
You look tired.
It's just how I look, sir, how my skull is.
Yeah, but your eyes, they look so sad.
Mm-hmm.
Like you've lived 100 lives.
Okay.
I mean, take Sam here, for example.
He doesn't look tired at all.
So one week then, or  Sebastian's so cool.
He's probably our coolest client.
I think he's the coolest guy I've ever met.
- Did you see his jacket? Leather.
- Mm-hmm.
Came in here and completely owned our couch.
- I know.
- Guy smells like a steak.
- A real good steak.
- Hey, guys.
- Both: 'Sup, Lea? - How you gonna  - What's going on? - What's going on?  - What's happening right now? - What are you in here for?  You know how I always have to stuff  all of our gear into my car for every shoot?  - Yeah, it's so funny.
- Yeah.
Well, I found a cheap production van we can buy.
Where?  At the police auction for impounded vehicles.
- Was this involved in a crime? - Yes.
[Elevator bell dings.]
[Groovy music.]
Tim and Sam! I got a bunch  of new commercial ideas for you guys, man.
Sorry, Ned.
Can't talk right now.
For real? Hey, they gon' 100%  suck your [Bleep.]
with these new ones, man,  I'm telling you.
Listen to this.
Ready for this?  Hefty garbage bags: Now for white people.
Great stuff, Ned.
Tell you what.
You make an appointment sometime,  we'll hear all your pitches.
Hey, thank you, man.
I'ma hold you to that, man.
I appreciate it! Mm!  [Funk music.]
[Horn blares.]
What do you think?  - Slams okay.
- Mm-hmm.
- Want to give it a test drive? - Yeah.
Seats are comfy.
It's nice.
You guys done jerking each other off?  You see jizz everywhere, Lea?  Yeah, Lea, if we were jerking each other off,  there'd be jizz everywhere.
I'll put in our bid.
This is great.
We can get twice as much work done with this van.
Absolutely.
We can work twice as hard.
Work ourselves into the ground  until we blow our brains out like Sebastian's dad.
Or go insane like my dad.
Mm-hmm.
Well,  let's go get this work van for work.
Let's do it.
[Funk music.]
Hey, TD!   Yeah, yeah!   I need some loving, baby   You need what now?   Some loving, some loving, some loving   Huh! Oh, yeah!   [Screams.]
Huh! Oh, yeah!   Oh, this loving, baby You need loving   Yeah, yeah Oh, loving, loving   You need some loving loving   So good, baby   I got to tell you, baby   What you gonna tell me?  What you got to do, yeah   What I got to do, baby?   Just listen to the song yeah   [Music fades out.]
Assholes.
Next time   when they ask you   where you're from   you gon' say Detroit city   when we get you back on our feet   yeah, yeah   I got to get back on that road, man.
Oh, wow, I'm gonna go nuts in here.
Oh, tell me about it.
Is that stuff working?  I don't know.
The guy at the store said it's makeup for plays  that have a dumpy uncle character.
Hey, pecker, eyes off the hog! Pecker's taking a selfie.
I'll tell you this, man.
I don't get back out on that hog,  I'm about four or five seconds from wilin'.
I'm about two, three seconds from wilin'.
I'm like, one second from wilin'.
Gentlemen.
Ned is here.
The security guard?  He said you told him to set up an appointment.
Sheila!  You weren't actually supposed to set that up.
Oh, I guess I had a dumb blonde moment.
She thinks she's blonde?  I hope y'all ready for this shit, man.
This shit is coming out of the idea oven hot and fresh.
Let's see what you got.
All right.
[Clears throat.]
Chris Brown is walking to the store.
Did he just say Chris Brown?  Chris Brown is getting his baby some diapers, right?  Chris Brown's having a bad day 'cause he just found out  that his woman is cheating on him,  and the baby he been buying all these diapers  and groceries and shit for  is not even his baby, and he's got to piss.
The baby or Chris Brown?  Chris Brown.
The baby's dead.
- Oh, for sure.
- Yeah, yeah.
Of course.
So then he can't even hold it anymore.
He's like, "Oh, I got to go to a restaurant.
"  I got to pee immediately," right?  Bam.
He goes to the restaurant,  but the restaurant has a restroom  that says, "For whites only.
"  He's like, "What?"  "For whites only?" Then he thinks about it,  like, "wait a minute, I got all these diapers.
"  So next thing you know, we cut.
Bam.
We see the back of Chris Brown's legs, right?  Then a big-ass dick falls out of his drawers.
It's like, oh, he might have a disease.
Way too big for sex or anything,  and he's pissing in the diaper, and it's like  [imitating extended urination.]
He looks back at the camera and says,  "Diapers: They can hold a man's piss.
"  I mean, it's great stuff, Ned.
Just one problem.
I mean, we don't have the "diapers" account.
Even if we did I'm pretty sure we can't show any of that stuff.
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got more.
- I'm not married to anything.
- Right.
Next one.
A guy's running from the cops, right?  He's running fast.
"Get down!  We got a runner!" [Panting.]
[Grunts.]
[Panting.]
Right?  He has on Reeboks.
So fast!  The police have on Nikes.
Hell, no, they're not gon' catch him.
He about to run to the finish line.
Ha! Victory!  Got away from the police! Bam!  They shoot him.
He dead.
Chyron: Reeboks.
He dead.
- What else you got? - Ready for this one?  Okay, a guy's sticking his dick all in a big-ass tub of butter.
- Oh, lord.
Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He just, boop, dropping holes in the butter.
Boop, dropping holes in the butter.
Boop, dropping holes in the butter  Dick holes.
Next thing you know,  the cops come, shoot him.
He dead.
Chyron: Butter.
He dead.
- Okay.
- There's a guy  walking around town dancing with his hand in his pocket.
Okay, and then what happens?  He just dances.
That's it.
Okay.
Well, Ned, this is all great stuff  and we'd love to hear it, but we got actually  a really important meeting we got to get to.
Gentlemen, Dale Diebenkorn is here  and he's stinking up the place.
[Groans.]
"No sale" Dale.
That guy is a fricking pud.
Can't believe we're gonna be in here stuck with that idiot  instead of out there on our crotch rocket.
We've been pitching to this choad  for a year and a half, and he's never bought anything.
Tim, Cramblin-Duvet's doing what?  Both: Gangbusters.
Maybe it's time we decided whether we want to be  in here making a living  or out there making a life.
[Whispering.]
I get you.
Can I have these?  Dale, I'd like to introduce you  to our brand new hot shot copywriter Ned.
You're in really good hands.
Ned's going to walk you through some of our ideas  that we're really excited about.
Put 'er there, Dale.
Man, you got a nice-ass neck, you know that?  You can tell a lot about a man by his neck, man,  and you got a strong one.
Uh, thanks.
Sweet! We'll get out of your hair.
It's almost like a Benjamin Franklin neck.
You kind of got a Benjamin Franklin whole head.
[Mc5's "the American ruse".]
They told you in school about freedom   But when you try to be free they never let ya   They said "It's easy nothing to it"   And now the army's out to get ya   '69 America in terminal stasis   The air's so thick it's like drowning in molasses   I'm sick and tired of paying these dues   And I'm finally getting hip to the American ruse     - Whoo! - Whoo!  [Laughs.]
[Elevator bell dings.]
I am gonna miss the hog today,  but we got to get back to the real world.
Back to the grind.
Both: Morning, Sheila.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Where are you two going?  To stuff all this equipment into my car  because you two idiots didn't buy a van.
Hey guys, nice jackets.
- Thank you.
- I've always worn this.
[Laughs.]
All right.
Appreciate everything.
Oh, hey, guys.
You were right about Ned.
He's amazing.
This commercial's going to be great.
Sure is.
What commercial?  Oh, Dale's commercial.
Oh, no, Ned's commercial.
[Scoffs.]
Let's go shoot this bitch.
Let's do it.
Well, good luck.
I guess we got to get to this commercial shoot?  Yeah.
I mean, I guess it'd be totally irresponsible  to leave an entire shoot to Ned  and just go riding around on a hog all day.
Oh, for sure.
If I gave even the smallest shit about Dale's pud ass,  I'd put a stop to this right now.
And plus my crotch is throbbin' for a rocket.
Oh.
My crotch is achin' for one!  - Let's do this, baby.
- Let's do it.
- Night, Sheila.
- Night, Sheila.
Good night, gentlemen.
[Mc5's "the American ruse" playing.]
Other way, Tommy.
What the heck?  [Funk music.]
- Stay safe, guys.
- See ya, guys.
Good times.
Earlier today, the ghost of a pedophile  was spotted haunting the old Boblo amusement park.
Here's the interesting thing:  The ghost was Get this a woman.
More after these messages.
[Funk music playing on TV.]
Oh, look, it's Ned's commercial.
Right now at Detroit Optical Glasses,  we have hunky specs, but be warned:  Hunky specs will make you feel like grooving.
Oh, hunky specs   gonna get you grooving, grooving   -  D-O-G  grooving   gonna get you grooving, ooh   uh-huh   - Freeze! - Sorry, officers.
Can't freeze.
I got to dance.
He's resisting.
- [Grunts.]
- Stop resisting!  Hunky specs will make you feel like grooving.
Only at D-O-G.
- [Grunts.]
- But I'm white!  Presented by Cramblin Advertising.
Oh, man.
That was bad.
I can't believe Ned put a title card at the end of it.
Now everybody'going to think we made that turd.
Dale's probably so pissed.
Should we call him and ask him if he wants us to pull the spot?  - Yeah, maybe.
- I don't usually comment  on the commercials,  but that was a lot of fun.
Let's see it again.
Can we?  Groovin'.
Uh-huh   [Laughter.]
Right now at Detroit Optical Glasses  What The Whoo-hoo.
Hunky specs that make you feel like grooving.
I got to get me some of those horny specs.
[Laughs.]
Gonna get you groovin'  D-O-G   -  Groovin'  - I don't get it.
Are they laughing with it or at it?  They're just laughing, Sam.
They're feeling joy.
I don't get it.
It's nothing!  Stop dancing!  You're wasting your time!  Don't look at me, asshole!  [Funk music.]
Sebastian, how was Dubai?  Oh, incredible.
You know, I went to the Burj Khalifa  and I did that thing that Tom Cruise did  in "Mission: Impossible.
"  Oh.
You climbed up the windows with suction cups?  I got to wear the mask of another man's face.
Holy shit.
That's cool.
So Sebastian,  we're going to be shooting your commercial tomorrow.
Uh, any questions or concerns?  Actually, yes.
Uh, let's scrap it.
What?  Yeah.
I want the dance.
The dance?  Yes, you know.
The hunky specs.
Yeah, yeah.
I want I want that.
Okay, uh, what if we just added a dance component  to the commercial that we already pitched you?  Yeah, like, uh, what if,  like, maybe the dad in the tent  kind of, like, wiggles his booty?  Oh, yeah, yeah, he makes his booty clap.
- [Laughs.]
- Oh, that's good.
Actually, that's great.
You know, that could work.
- It definitely could.
- Guys, guys, guys.
Don't leave me half-hard here.
Why are we talking about the old ad?  I want the full-on dance treatment.
That's what I want.
All right.
Okay.
Um So, okay.
All right, so maybe you're, um,  maybe you're walking through your store,  you look to camera, you're just like  Why would I do that?  I don't know, sir.
It's not sexy.
Uh, well, actually, what if the dance is more like, uh  Okay.
Feel it.
Feel it.
You feel it.
You just kind of feel it.
You're gonna ooh.
Oh, there's something in my tummy.
It's more groovin'.
It's groovin'.
Now it's a baby.
There it is.
Fellas, is this some sort of joke?  Because I consider myself a really chill dude,  but you are pissing me off.
Now, what happened to the guys who  came up with the hunky specs commercial, huh?  Look, you have every right to be angry.
Please allow us a moment to discuss.
No.
What are we gonna do now?  I don't know.
I honestly thought my dancing was sexy.
Gentlemen.
Jean and Louise Strhol  from Strhol's Icecream are here to see you.
Strhol's Icecream?  We have been trying to get a meeting with them for months.
This is huge.
Where are they?  I put them in the conference room.
Son of a bitch.
Crap.
[Phone ringing.]
Hello, Mother.
Sheila, can you tell Ned  he has two clients waiting for him?  Where are you two going?  Doesn't matter.
Good-bye, Mother.
Bitch.
[Elevator bell dings.]
[Sad music.]
[Bike bell jingles.]
He left me wondering   Down the road I went   Oh, father what's she from?   Heaven sent     Doesn't matter now does it?   When I'm on my own   Gonna keep on walking   Till I'm skin and bone   If you could start over and do any job in the entire world,  what would you do?  Probably make commercials at Cramblin-Duvet.
Me too.
What would you do if you had $10 million?  I'd expand Cramblin-Duvet,  get a bigger building with on-site daycare.
Can I be honest with you, Sam?  Yeah, bud.
I am scared every second on that thing.
Tim, I hate it.
If you stop, you fall.
Yeah, and if you fall, you die.
Yeah, and then you die, it just goes black.
You don't even hear anything.
Why would they make something that does that?  I mean, I don't even like being outside.
No, me neither.
Let's get out of here.
I just saw one of those big, fat, fuzzy bees.
[Engine revving.]
You black night with that   Nice bike.
It's yours.
Now why won't you leave me?   Need a helmet?  Don't need one.
[Engine revving.]
[Mc5's "the American ruse".]
Hey, guys.
Ned.
What are you doing down here?  Guys, thanks for letting me work for the company.
I really appreciate it, great experience.
But I found I like my ideas better as ideas.
You know, 'cause once the money gets involved,  is it even art anymore?  Plus, the ice cream ladies really, really didn't like  the commercial I made for them.
- Oh, no.
- What'd you do, Ned?  I had a guy put his dick in the ice cream.
Yeah, you can't do that.
Yeah.
It turns out they don't like that.
But they're wrong.
- No, I know.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- Good luck, Ned.
You guys hang in there, man.
It's tough up there.
You know, fellas, I'm sorry.
After talking to Ned,  I think I want to go back to the first idea.
Yeah, I think that is a great call.
You're cool with that?  - Yes.
Yes.
- Yes.
Unless of course Ned can get Chris Brown.
He cannot.
[Car horn honking.]
[Laughs.]
It's Lea.
And Tommy pencils.
They got a van.
[Folk music.]
- You got the van? - Yep,  and it was even cheaper.
The guy who bought it  at the police auction was murdered in it.
- Oh, score.
- Oh, and Tommy has  a surprise for you.
He worked really hard on it.
Be nice.
Ta-da!  Is that us?  Yes it is, fellas.
Do you like it?  Yeah.
Good job, Tommy.
Great job, Tommy.
Yeah, great job, Tommy.
I like how you captured my pink lips.
Yeah, I like how you captured my little corn cob mouth.
And my raccoon mask, and my gray, gray skin.
- Yellow ears.
- Yellow nose, too.
And my double chin.
Make sure you got the double chin perfectly.
Yeah, no, I see it, man.
I see it.
Pube hair, pube eyebrows.
My whole goblin face.
And I got your blue eyes!  [Laughs.]
Yeah, you did.
Thanks, Tommy.
You're welcome, Tim.

1 [upbeat music.]
Oh, shit!  [laughing.]
Ow, ow.
- Are you okay? - Here, can you give me a hand?  - Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh, gosh.
Ow, okay.
[slow bluesy rock music.]
Hi.
[both laugh.]
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Samantha.
My friends call me Sam, so  What a coincidence.
My friends call me Samantha.
Oh!  Sam.
Sam!  Tim's stomach is upset,  and he wants you to come rub his belly.
- Why don't you do it? - He wants you.
Tell him to bring the Vernors.
My guts are going nuts.
And he wants you to bring the Vernors.
- Yeah, I heard him.
- My guts are going nuts!  I've, uh I've got to go.
My friend can't poop unless I rub his belly.
I'll be right back if you  - I think I'm gonna go.
- Okay.
It's probably a no-go, okay.
- Okay.
- Ooh, you're with a lady.
Shut up, Tim.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   [bluesy rock music playing.]
So WebMD says I have colitis.
Turns out when I lost all that weight,  I thought I was getting healthier.
I was actually getting sick.
So now I can't have milk, ice cream, cheese.
Can't have yogurt.
- Dairy.
- Yeah, exactly.
Dairy.
Can't have it, so Chrissy made me  a dairy-free dinner last night.
It was actually pretty good.
God, I love her.
Honestly, every day I wake up,  I'm so thankful to have her.
When are you gonna settle down, man?  - Can you help us settle a bet? - Sure.
Excuse me!  We're talking!  Move it along.
Thanks.
Seriously, man, when are you gonna settle down?  It's amazing.
Yeah, Tim, I do want to meet somebody.
Then what is stopping you?  Hey, I like your shirt.
That color looks great on you.
Oh, so you just interrupt people?  Is that your whole gig, you interrupt folks?  We don't know who you are.
Later, dude.
Seriously, why are you not settling down?  Because of you, Tim!  It's impossible to meet girls around you.
Okay, that's insane.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Okay, I'm insane, then.
Suit yourself, man.
Giving you advice.
What if he's right?  What if he is insane  and I'm just a figment of his imagination?  [chuckles.]
Oh, man.
[stomach growls.]
[groans.]
Oh, no.
Oh, crap.
Tell Sam the Vernors kicked in.
[yells.]
Tim said to tell you the Vernors started working.
Ah, that means he had to go home and dump.
Everybody knows what that means.
Yeah, grown man can only poop at home.
I can poop anywhere, anytime.
- Okay.
- Yzerman Drive was bananas.
Yeah, well, it's Hockeytown, babe.
Sandy, get me a pop.
Make that two pops,  and I'll take some apps and ranch.
Excuse us.
Can we use your stool for our jackets?  Yeah, go nuts.
Oh, remind me.
We got to stop at Meijer's  for some crackers and pop.
[The Spinners' "Could it Be I'm Falling In Love?".]
[smooth R&B music.]
Since I met you   I've begun to feel so strange   Every time I speak your name   That's funny   You say that you   Are so helpless too   That you don't know what to do   Hoo   Each night I pray   There will never come a day   When you up and take your love away   Say you feel the same way too   And I wonder what   [music stops abruptly.]
[elegant piano music playing.]
[both smooching.]
What the  [smooching and moaning.]
You can't do that.
[chuckles softly.]
[whispering.]
I'd like to order him a martini.
Absolutely.
I didn't order that, and I'm not paying for that.
It's a freaking scam, dude.
Compliments of Councilwoman Gwinnett.
Oh!  Ah.
- Hi there.
- Hey.
[both chuckle.]
Uh, thanks for the drink.
Oh, sure.
Are you alone?  Well, not anymore.
I'm looking for a good time.
Well you found one.
[chuckles.]
[upbeat music.]
Cock-a-doodle-doo!  [birds chirping.]
Hey.
- That was good.
- Yeah.
So until the next time.
[funky music.]
I mean, well, there's got to be  a lot of reasons why she'd leave $300  on my nightstand.
Sure, maybe she broke something  and she wanted to pay for it.
Morning hot dogs for Sam  and hot dogs benedict for my lady.
Thank you, babe.
Well, she did rip my Superman underwear  when she took them off.
Well, there you go.
But if that's true,  she wildly overvalued them.
Not if you account for sentimental value.
- You loved those.
- I did love those.
- You did.
- Well, that's it.
Both: That's it.
We figured it out.
That's easy.
That's actually pretty easy.
That's one of our best mysteries.
No.
Sam, she thinks you're a whore.
Chrissy!  Why would she need a prostitute?  She's amazing.
Hold on.
Eliot Spitzer was amazing.
- Is.
- Is.
He looks like Skeletor with the skin on.
Mm-mm-mm!  And he used prostitutes, Sam.
Mm-hmm.
[funky rock music.]
If you want to know   [wolf whistle.]
Where it all belongs   Ow!  It's magic   Aw, suki, suki!  Oh     If you ever go   Don't be scared   'Cause you know   There's magic   Na-ah, na, na-na   Na-na, na, na   Na-na, na, na, na-na-na   Na, na   Na, na, na   Na, na, na, na   Na-na, na, na, na na-na   Na, na   Na, na, na   Na, na, na, na   Na-na, na, na, na-na-na, na   Oh, my God, you're a full-on prostitute now.
No, I'm not.
My lady just likes her baby looking fine,  so she gives me monetary gifts  so I can buy nice things.
Now, where's the remote?  Rachel's giving a press conference,  and she said she's gonna work my name into her speech.
I would like to assure the people of Detroit  that I have done no wrong.
And at the Sam time  Psh, barely.
I'm sorry, at the same time,  I would also like to apologize to Speaker Roberts  for calling him a minion.
- [laughter.]
- Any questions?  Look at him.
[reporters clamoring.]
Over here.
Right here, right here, right here.
Councilwoman, I have a question for you.
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.
How are you?  I'm good.
How was your day? Anything happen?  You know Cheryl who works on the line next to me?  Of course.
Turns out she was an undercover boss.
No shit.
Yeah, fake hair, fake nose, everything.
She's, like, the CEO of Chrysler.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
How was your day?  Sam's a full-on prostitute now.
Yeah, monochrome suit, earring, the whole nine yards.
What an idiot.
Such an idiot, getting all dressed up,  having drinks at fancy hotels.
Then going upstairs for dirty, meaningless sex  with no strings attached.
Monochrome suits, earring, the whole nine yards.
No names, just sweat and bodies.
- Monochrome suit.
- [scoffs.]
What do you want for dinner?  Milk and cheese, please.
- You can't have dairy.
- Pizza.
[both laughing.]
[both sigh.]
I got you something.
It's a Pandora bracelet.
'Cause, you know,  that's the nature of our relationship.
We both give each other things, you know.
Yup, this one's a heart, you know, for obvious reasons.
This one's an owl because you finished college.
And this one's a soccer ball because it's rad.
I'm sorry.
Sam, did I misinterpret something?  What do you mean?  [mumbling.]
Are you a prostitute?  What?  [mumbling.]
Are you a prostitute?  I'm sorry, one more time.
[whispering.]
Are you sure you're a prostitute?  M-me?  Of course I'm a prostitute, all right?  Just checking.
Good.
Good night, Sam,  or whatever your real name is.
It's Sam.
From the lady.
I don't want it.
Hey, wait  I'm a fricking whore.
[dance music.]
Sam.
What is the meaning of this?  "Get satisfied today by Sam 'The Man' Duvet"?  Tim, she pressed me about really being  a prostitute; I freaked out.
You know, I thought I got to create a paper trail.
This is offensive.
Tim, I'm not actually a prostitute.
No, I'm offended you didn't come to me to produce this ad.
I could have done so much with you.
Can't even see your nipples.
How's it doing?  Not bad.
A lot of texts, mostly wang pics.
The real mistake was using my actual phone number.
- Oh, sure, yeah.
- [cell phone chimes.]
Oh, come on.
Oh!  Tim, you think this is all worth it?  Do you think she really likes me?  No, man.
I think she thinks you're a fricking prostitute.
Yeah, but I really, really like her,  and, you know, maybe if I keep this up long enough,  she'll discover that she really, really likes me too.
[chuckles.]
Like in "She's All That"?  Exactly like in "She's All That.
"  I have a delivery from Councilwoman Gwinnett  for Sam Duvet?  Councilwoman Gwinnett would like to see you  at the charity event tonight  at the Detroit Institute of Arts.
She'd like you to wear this.
[soft guitar music.]
Tim, a tuxedo,  a charity event, a museum?  Mm.
Tim, tonight might be the night.
You did it.
You "She's All That'd" her.
I sure did.
[lounge music playing.]
[indistinct chatter.]
Change in plans.
I need you to get out of here.
- Get out of here? - Yes.
And who is that?  Is that another pro?  Does he have an ad in the paper?  Because I do.
That's my husband.
- Husband? - Yes.
You're married?  Sam, would you keep your voice down?  I will not keep my voice down!  Okay, Sam, you need to pull it together.
I mean, what am I to you?  A man that I pay for sex.
Yeah, but when we met,  didn't you feel a connection?  No, not really.
You were at the Jefferson Hotel.
You were holding a single rose.
That's the signal for a honey boy  open for business.
So that's all I am to you, huh?  Just some honey boy, huh?  [loudly, voice echoing.]
That's all I am,  just some big dick for money, huh?  Is that it?  Just a veiny wang with a knot at the end  and two huge, pendulum balls?  Is that all I am, huh?  Yeah, just a guy with a Joe Louis fist in his pants  and a freshly bleached butthole you could eat off of?  Mwah! Mama mia.
Is that it?  Well, Rachel, this huge,  honking pecker is attached to a body,  and that body has a heart  and a soul and a brain  and arms, feet, neck,  and and and and and  - Sam.
- Yeah, I know.
I lost the thread there.
What was I s  And just a huge pecker!  [slow R&B music playing.]
From the lady.
Thanks for the drink.
I'm looking for a date tonight.
That's gonna cost you.
[chuckles.]
How much?  $1 million.
A million dollars?  Worth every penny.
No, thanks.
What do you mean, "No, thanks"?  We're pretending.
What's it matter?  A million dollars?  It's pretend money.
Okay,  what does a million dollars get me?  [chuckles.]
Salad tossing, to completion.
[laughs.]
$500,000.
Ooh!  Fine, I'll do it,  but my pimp's gonna kill me.
Say, pretty boy,  what's your name?  Sam Duvet.
Ugh, Tim, that's nasty.
You could pick any name in the world,  and you pick my brother's?  My name is  Chrissy Cramblin.
That's my name.
I'm not good at making up names.
- Just come on.
- My name?  Bubba Sparxxx.
[slow rock music playing.]
Hey, pal.
You all right?  I don't want to talk about it.
Scandal rocks local government  as Councilwoman Rachel Gwinnett  was caught using city funds  to buy the services of a local male prostitute.
Oh, no.
My parents are gonna see this.
Don't worry.
They won't know it's you.
The honey boy in question, Sam "The Man" Duvet,  was confirmed to be a prostitute  thanks to the following unreleased ad.
Are you a party girl?  I can dance all night, baby.
[dance music.]
Touching.
Licking.
Butts.
[yells.]
Orgasmic.
Well, how'd they get that?  I sent it in.
It's the best thing we've ever done, Sam.
We now go live  to Councilwoman Gwinnett's press conference.
Once again, I apologize to the city of Detroit.
I've let you down.
I should have never consorted  with that bimbo.
And the worst thing is, he wasn't all that good.
Oh, well, she's lying about that.
- Sure, I know.
- He wasn't all that good.
And he had an aggressively medium wang.
She's lying! She's a liar.
Next up, Red Wings fans  have something to cheer about,  as they recover two frozen bodies from the ice.
See those girls playing pool?  One of them was looking at you.
Come on, I'll introduce you.
- No way.
- Oh, don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous, Tim.
You're just a terrible wingman.
Fine, I'll just stay here.
You go on over there.
I'm just some guy at the bar  who doesn't even know you, doesn't love you.
Go on, buddy.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.
[slow bluesy rock music.]
I got next.
Well, that means you'll be playing me.
- Oh, does it? - Mm-hmm.
- I'm Sam.
- Vickie.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Sorry, ladies.
- Don't.
- I don't know this guy.
But I want to say  Why would you touch me?  He seems like a great guy,  the kind of guy you'd be proud  to bring home to your parents.
Just thought I'd drop by and say that.
I'll get out of your way.
[both laugh.]
- That was weird.
- Right?  Well, he's not wrong.
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
Mm!  So you playing eight ball?  - Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
I just realized that last interaction  may have come across a little weird.
That's because I forgot to introduce myself.
My name's Mike Cyclops.
I work for NASA.
- NASA? - And let me just tell you,  there is a lot they're not telling you, man.
Trust me.
I worked security at Area 51.
Got kicked out for banging one of the aliens.
She was hot too.
She, he, it It had everything,  and I love that.
Oh, God, I miss her.
I really do.
Uh [laughs.]
Uh, so what  - I'm sorry.
- Oh, for [bleep.]
I lied.
I do know him.
I was his Uber driver.
I just wanted to come over here  and tell you that, in case you felt  that there was an undeniable preexisting chemistry.
Yeah, I'm an Uber driver.
It's actually pretty fun.
It can be fun.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, great.
- So - Two fricking stars?  Are you kidding me?  After you farted in my car?  Tim!  Didn't even roll down the window.
- Ew! - Tim, why are you doing this?  I don't know.
I think, deep down,  I want to sabotage your relationships  so I can have you all to myself.
He's a piece of shit.
Uh  So, uh, Veronica  - Vickie.
- Vickie.
- Whatever.
- Vickie, yeah.
I couldn't help but notice you were watching me,  checking me out from over at the bar.
Yeah, you're that prostitute from the news, right?  [laughing.]
I was never really a prostitute.
Let's make that clear.
She just paid me for sex.
[yells.]

Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
We guarantee our wigs  aren't made from hair off dead bodies.
Ooh, Devereux   From Rhonda Devereux   I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.
- You don't? - Why not?  Well, let's just cut to the chase.
Why bring up the thing about dead body hair?  Our wigs aren't made with dead body hair.
- Yeah, that's the whole point.
- So why bring it up?  Advertising 101.
Answer the question before they ask it.
Who's asking that question?  Rhonda, the main reason people  don't buy wigs is because  they're afraid they're made from dead people hair.
But our wigs aren't made from dead people hair.
Yeah, I feel like we're saying the same thing here.
Okay, you don't like the mention of dead people hair.
Fine.
We'll look at that.
Is there anything else?  Yeah, that song.
Is that you two singing?  [both laugh.]
Guilty as charged.
- Yeah, it is.
It is.
- Oh, okay, okay.
When are you gonna bring in the real singers?  I'm sorry, did you say real singers?  Yeah, real singers.
- [laughs.]
- Wow.
- I mean - I mean, like, real singers?  I mean, I'm right here.
I'm listening.
I'm going, "What the [bleep.]
?"  - WTF? - I mean, she's like,  "Real singers," to my face, to your face.
Dumb to my face, you know what I mean?  There is to be absolutely no mention of dead people.
I just want a sexy lady on a sexy horse  and a nice, sexy song  I mean, that's basically what you got.
Not sung by you two.
[groans.]
Next time when they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    [phone ringing.]
Cramblin Advertising.
No, he went crazy.
Well, mama said there'd be days like this.
I mean, I know I put up a good front in there,  but that "real singers" comment honestly bothered me.
- I had a feeling.
- I mean, I almost cried.
You should have.
You know, as professional and calm as I seemed in there,  I was actually a little pissed  about that dead people hair thing.
Real singers.
She asked for real singers.
What does that make us, huh, fake singers?  Hey.
You can't just say it to somebody and not expect them  to cry in the middle of a business meeting.
You know what we need to do right now?  Go down to the morgue and check the heads for hair?  No.
That is a great idea, though.
But first  Up next, Tim and Sam, everybody, Tim and Sam.
I know you want to leave me   But I refuse to let you go   If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy   I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me   Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darling   Please don't leave me, girl   Both:  Don't you go   Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby   Please don't leave me, girl   Both:  Don't you go   Now, I've heard a crying man   -  Ain't half a man  -  Half a man   With no sense of pride   No sense of pride   If I have to cry to keep you   I don't mind weeping if it'll keep you   Both:  By my side!   Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darling   Please don't leave me   Tim and Sam, everybody!  Give it up for Sam!  [cheers and applause.]
And Tim.
[crowd murmuring.]
Great job, Sam.
- Amazing job, Sam.
- Thank you.
Hey, Timmy.
So, Tim, I was thinking  about what Rhonda said,  and I may have come up with a way  to fix the Devereux Wigs jingle.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
Uh, so I was thinking,  maybe instead of both of us singing the song,  what if I just  Ladies and gentlemen,  I don't want to put him on the spot,  but we have a legendary singer in the house tonight.
Maybe we can get him on the stage.
Come on, everybody, Freddie "Motown" Brown.
[cheers and applause.]
Come on, everybody.
Please, Freddie, just one song.
Listen.
Y'all crazy.
Y'all crazy.
[cheers and applause.]
I ain't getting paid to do this shit.
Hit it.
I came home to an empty house, flowers in my hand   Found my baby, she left town with another man   Oh, I cried   Oh, I cried   I cried an ocean of tears   Yeah   I'm a ship lost at sea   And there's a storm rolling in   Need my baby here with me   What were you saying about Devereux?  Oh, I was gonna say  maybe Freddie "Motown" Brown should sing the jingle.
- Yeah.
- Right?  Yeah.
But that's not what you were gonna say.
- Yeah, it was.
- No, 'cause you didn't  even know he was here when you started talking.
Come on, man.
Yeah, yeah   - [camera shutter clicks.]
- Bam.
[laughs.]
I like that.
Hi.
Can I get a Crown Royal on the rocks  and let me keep that little velvet bag.
Mm-hmm.
[clears throat.]
You know, "Ocean of Tears"  is my favorite song in the whole world.
Mine too.
[laughs.]
Ka-ching.
How you doing? Tim Cramblin, Cramblin Advertising.
And Sam Duvet, Cramblin-Duvet Advertising.
[laughs.]
I'm just kidding.
It's just Cramblin Advertising.
- It was my father's company.
- Yeah, but he went nuts,  and we took over.
He's my best friend.
I'm married to his sister.
- But she's an idiot.
- Leave her alone.
- I love her.
- [both laugh.]
Sir, we represent Rhonda Devereux of Devereux Wigs.
We were wondering if you'd be interested in singing a jingle  - for one of their commercials.
- Mm-mm.
A commercial's just not my thing, you know.
I don't do commercials.
Well, is there anything we could do  to make you change your mind?  No.
But I'll tell you what you can do.
Give me a ride home.
- Sure, you got it, Freddie.
- Absolutely, sir.
Where do you live?  - Lake Orion.
- Oh, wow.
It ain't that far!  No, no, no, it's our pleasure.
It's pretty far.
My dad knows Diana Ross.
Cool.
Come on in, yes, sir.
Welcome, welcome.
- Oh, nice place, Freddie.
- Yeah.
I won this place in a card game from the Four Tops.
That's why there's exactly four rooms.
They were living here together like the Ninja Turtles.
The Ninja Turtles live in the sewer.
Yeah, but together.
Is this a real gold record, Freddie?  Yes, it is.
Got that back in 1968  for "Dancin' on 12th Street.
"  Cool.
Want to see something really cool?  [dreamy music.]
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
[laughs.]
Yeah, baby.
These are all the suits I wore back in my Motown days.
Got married in that one.
Got divorced in that one, same day.
This one, Motown 25.
This one, Tom Green pranked me in, made me eat goo.
You just don't do that to people.
Piece of shit.
I know it's rude to ask but  You want to put the suits on.
Yes, sir, very much so.
[music stops abruptly.]
I'll do it if Sam's doing it.
[upbeat soul music.]
Keep working.
That's it.
Right on the money.
- Look at this.
- Check this out.
You can that's good.
[upbeat soul music continues.]
You got it good.
That's you.
That's you.
This is me.
Cheers to Lake Orion.
It's not that far.
It was.
It really was.
That's good.
Ooh, look at all those albums.
Yeah, that's my whole career on one wall.
This is my first album.
Tiny Freddie Brown.
I'm 12 years old.
If you look way back in the corner,  that's my daddy standing there with a belt in his hand.
This is a Christmas album called "Jingle These Bells.
"  All the songs are about Santa doing the nasty.
Yeah.
Over there, look over there.
That's my alter ego, Astro Freddie and the Aliens.
Really, really trippy.
Scares me to just walk by.
Look at those eyes.
- [ominous musical flourish.]
- Ugh.
California Raisins, y'all remember that?  - Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, we did a less racist version  of that called the Milwaukee Peaches.
Needless to say, we didn't sell a lot of those albums.
You know, Freddie, speaking of sales, you know,  we'd pay you to sing the Devereux Wigs ad.
It ain't gonna happen, guys, not today.
The last two ad execs came in here  and tried to convince me to do a commercial,  they took my civil rights anthem  and turned it into a commercial for a damn water park.
They're hosing us down   They're hosing us down   At the Four Bears Water Park   I love that commercial.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Well, you can't blame us for trying, right, Freddie?  Yeah.
You know, "Ocean of Tears" is the first album  - I ever bought.
- And I sold him that album.
I did very well on that deal.
Very well.
- It really is my favorite song.
- You know what?  There's really a great story  how I came up with the idea of "Ocean of Tears,"  and I love telling it.
Not enough people hear it.
Y'all want to hear it?  - Absolutely.
- Yes, sir.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
"Ocean of Tears.
"  You see, boys, it was back in 1965.
I'm on a double billing with Junior Walker  and the All-Stars.
I'm thinking to myself, just out of nowhere,  "What  "if a man cried so much,  "he cried  and made an ocean of tears?"  Yeah.
Yeah, that's what we figured.
You don't get it.
I'm talking about the man cried  an ocean made of tears.
That's it.
You got it, mm-hmm.
Freddie, I always listen  to that song whenever a girl breaks my heart.
Who's the girl that you wrote that song about?  You know, then I was imagining an ocean.
You got fish.
You got shark.
You got whales.
You got shrimp and scuba men,  but, you know, they're not swimming in ocean water.
No, no!  They're swimming in an ocean of  Tears, we get it.
Exactly.
Tears.
- Is that the whole story? - Mm-hmm.
That's the whole story behind   "Ocean of Tears.
"  It's not a very good story, Freddie.
It's not great.
- What? - It's not a good story.
It's not a good It's not a good story?  Well, [bleep.]
you, dude.
- Sorry.
- Freddie, we really are sorry.
No, I don't want to hear it.
Get out!  I told Johnny goddamn Carson the same story.
The man cried.
You two ungrateful son of a bitches  get out of Lake Orion,  and don't you never come back.
- That shouldn't be a problem.
- Tim.
Asshole and asshole light.
[door slams.]
[car doors slam.]
Well, now what?  I just say we go back to Rhonda  and demand we sing the jingle.
We always sing our own jingles.
Tim  there may be a way to make Rhonda happy  without having to rerecord the jingle.
Yeah?  I don't like it,  and you do a lot of things very well.
Thank you.
But maybe  instead of both of us singing the jingle  [screams.]
Oh, my God.
[laughs.]
I changed my mind.
I'm gonna do your commercial.
That's great, Freddie.
But why?  You know why, 'cause you are the first people to ever tell me  my "Ocean of Tears" story sucked.
I thought about it, and it does suck.
- Yeah.
- It really does.
- Yeah, it does.
- I think we were expecting  a story about, like, a really bad breakup you had.
Which is a much better story.
See, you guys are good.
But I want y'all to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.
- Get your candy asses  in the house and take those damn suits off.
- Yeah, you got it.
- Absolutely.
- You got it, bud.
- Get the hell in there.
Yeah, yeah.
I want to get my stuff anyway, my wallet.
Okay, ready when you are.
Ooh, Devereux?  Yeah, but kind of do it like, uh  Ooh, Devereux   That's nice, Sam, really nice.
Thank you.
Ooh, Devereux   That's great.
Maybe put a little something extra on it,  you know, like, like  Ooh, Devereux   Oh, you want me to put some stank on it, huh?  A little bit of stank on it.
Ooh, Devereux   Mm, yeah.
Yeah, also maybe try one like,  Ooh, Devereux   We got it.
Freddie, can we buy you lunch?  No, but you can give me a ride home.
God damn it.
I saw a car in his driveway.
You know what, Sam, you guys go ahead.
- I'll catch up, okay? - Yeah, all right.
Ooh, Devere  Nope.
No.
[clears throat.]
[voice cracking.]
Ooh, Devereux   [voice cracking.]
[singing out of tune scales.]
There we go.
Ooh, Devereux   Ooh, Devereux   For sure if that guy sings it.
Ooh, Deve   [screams tunelessly.]
Oh, Dev   Ooh, De   Ooh, Dev   Damn it, I can't sing!  [screams.]
So we took out all the stuff  about the dead body hair.
- Coward.
- Tim.
And we replaced our voices with  Well, let's just see if you can recognize for yourself.
Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
Oh, my God.
Is that who I think it is?  - It sure is.
- Smokey Robinson?  That's actually Freddie "Motown" Brown.
I love him.
Now, that's a real singer.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Enough!  The problem wasn't with our singing.
The problem was with my singing,  so either Sam sings the ad by himself, or nobody does.
Tim, it's all right.
I'm no Freddie "Motown" Brown.
No, Sam, you're right.
You're not.
You are twice the singer he is.
Jesus, Tim.
Look, we have other copies of that, so don't worry.
No, we don't.
I erased them all.
[snorts.]
Oh, really?  You erased all the copies.
Yeah, I erased them, so now Sam has to sing the song.
- How? - What do you how what?  How'd I erase them? I went in the computer.
I hacked into it, and I erased them all,  just like Dr.
Robot does.
You mean Mr.
Robot.
Shut up, Lea!  Lea, read the card, please.
"We want to apologize for Tim's behavior.
"We assure you, this has never happened before,  and it will never happen again.
"  Tim.
What's wrong with you?  Why didn't you ever tell me I can't sing?  Because you love singing.
Yeah, but why would you sing with me  if you knew you were better on your own?  Tim, we're a team.
I mean, we do everything together.
[phone ringing.]
Cramblin Advertising.
Hello, Mother.
[upbeat music.]
You know what, you're right.
We are a team.
Tim, where you going?  Tim?  Tim!  Where is he going?  Down the elevator.
[upbeat music.]
I need you to make me a sign.
I won't make a sign with the words  "dick," "pussy," or "shit.
"  Please print legibly.
Wait a minute.
What if my name was Dick Pussy?  Is your name Dick Pussy?  For the sake of this argument, yes, it is.
Okay, well, I'll make whatever sign you like, Mr.
Pussy.
Oh, please, call me Dick.
I'ma need two signs now  Please.
Company meeting! Company meeting.
Everyone or just creative?  - Everybody.
- Including crew?  Yeah, all three of you.
Come on.
Well, we can hear you from here.
Just say it.
Yeah, why should we have to move?  Would you just come here, please?  Gee.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to inform you  that Cramblin Advertising is now closed.
Tim, what did you do?  You've destroyed everything your father built.
- You're an idiot.
- No, none of that.
Shut up.
Cramblin Advertising is now closed,  but I'd like to invite you to the grand opening  of Cramblin-Duvet Advertising.
You changed the name.
Got it.
- Can I go? - Yes.
Am I gonna have to say all of that when I answer the phone?  Yes, you do, Sheila.
Buddy, you didn't have to do that.
Yeah, Sam, I did.
Because we're a team,  and we do everything together.
Also, I got you this.
Police say there were many, many survivors.
In business news, local store  Devereux Wigs was shut down after it was  discovered they were using dead people hair in their wigs.
I knew it!  We go live to consumer watchdog Tanya Stark,  who went down to the morgue today  to check the heads  and found many to be missing their hair.
Both: Should've checked the heads.
- Tanya.
- Blonds, brunettes,  redheads, all missing their hair  thanks to a grisly connection  with the glamorous world of Detroit wigs.
Tanya, I have to ask you.
Are you wearing a wig?  Why would he have to ask?  Ms.
Devereux, does Devereux Wigs use dead people's hair?  No, this is the first  I've heard anything about dead people hair.
Liar!  Why are you running then?  Ms.
Devereux! Ms.
Devereux!  - Oh, she ditches the cooler.
- Check the cooler.
Oh, you know, I think Tanya is wearing a wig.
Oh, she's about to whup her ass.
Dead people hair.
So great.
Very, very funny.

1 [R&B music playing.]
You look beautiful tonight.
Both: Thank you.
Who are you talking to?  My beautiful wife, of course.
Not my beautiful best friend.
David, Joy.
[laughing.]
Hey.
Hey.
Can you believe your dad is turning 60?  So old!  You know what he means to do? Start eating soft foods  so he won't have to get dentures in a minute.
That's not how teeth work, David.
- Huh? - Okay.
We better go work on our speeches for your father.
Y'all better bring your A-game.
I've got a little something special planned for tonight.
You don't have to say that to Sam.
He kills it every year.
- Ah, I guess I do, don't I? - [both laughing.]
All right, see you guys.
Later.
[sighs.]
These speeches make me so nervous  'cause you know Dad's just gonna pick it apart.
[chuckles.]
Ums and ahs  let the audience know you're not prepared.
You know what you're gonna say?  Please.
I spent the last year crafting  two pages of hilarious jokes about Dad's mustache.
Damn.
That is good.
Hey, happy birthday, Lawrence!  Oh, hey, Mom.
Hi, Daddy.
My darling.
[chuckles.]
[classy music playing.]
Son.
[dramatic music.]
[page crashes to the floor.]
[in slow motion.]
Dad, you  you shaved your mustache.
Yes, son.
One should never stop evolving.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to welcome my guests.
[laughs.]
Look at you two all dressed up.
[laughs.]
- Mommy.
- Come here, sweetie.
Hey, Mommy.
And Tim, look at you.
Give me a twirl.
[funk music playing.]
Come on! I love it! [laughter.]
Greetings.
Greetings, all of you.
My perfect wife and I would like to welcome you  to the celebration of my 60th birthday.
Now, my family teases me  about being too critical of the speeches  that people make at events like these.
[laughs.]
But I think they're exaggerating.
But now, if you're gonna make a speech,  pretend that there's a little, tiny baby  seated way in the back facing the wall.
That baby needs to hear your speech as well.
All right.
Enough with the formalities.
I think we all know what time it is.
[crowd murmurs.]
Let's hustle!  [funk music playing.]
[cheers and applause.]
- Are y'all ready? - [crowd cheering.]
Let's do it!    Hey!    - Whoo! - [all cheering.]
- So let's go.
- Later!  [all cheering.]
Hey! Ho!  Whoo!  Uh-huh! Whoo!  Next time   When they ask you where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get you back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   I'll never forget the day Mr.
Duvet  looked at me and said, "Son, you must have  a great plan to be a great man.
"  Happy birthday, Mr.
Duvet.
[applause.]
That was very good.
Thank you, Thomas.
Remember to enunciate.
[chuckles.]
[R&B music playing in the background.]
Sam, these mustache jokes are great.
Well, solid gold, baby.
But they're useless now.
Don't worry about me.
My speech gonna be just fine, okay?  Sam, take it easy on us this year.
Oh, you know I won't.
- [both laughing.]
- Yeah, this guy.
- All right now.
- [laughter.]
What the  There are clowns here?  That's just Mr.
Bones.
He's good friends with my dad.
I've never met a clown before.
You think you could introduce me?  Tim, does a circus bear shit on a toilet?  I don't know.
[groovy music.]
Hey, Mr.
Bones.
Oh, hi, Sam.
- He knows your name? - Yeah.
Uh, Mr.
Bones, I want you to meet my best friend, Tim.
Hey.
[groans.]
I'm a little scared.
Is it gonna hurt?  [grumbling.]
Uh, where's your joy buzzer?  I'm not working tonight.
Uh, you're in costume.
I just left a job and I have another job right after this.
Well, if you could just do  a little something for me, Mr.
Bones.
I'm not Mr.
Bones right now.
My name is Julian and I'm at my friend's birthday party.
Please, respect my privacy.
[sighs.]
Talking about one gag.
Young man, asking me to perform here  is like asking a mailman to go for a walk on his day off.
[laughs.]
Wait.
Was that the joke?  I guess it's kind of funny.
I bet you drive a funny little car.
I drive a 2013 Malibu.
Oh, what the [groans.]
You know, I'm not gonna get every joke.
And when when I got down to that hospital,  they told me the bill had already been paid by Mr.
Duvet.
- [applause.]
- [sobs.]
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
Uh, thank you very much, Joy.
You see, this is why microphone placement is so important.
When it's just perfect,  you can hear you even through your tears.
- [chuckles.]
Thank you, Joy.
- [applause.]
Molly, what are you doing here?  Well, officially, I'm checking out a B&E on Linwood,  but unofficially, your parents invited me  and they sat us next to each other.
Looks like they wish we were back together.
[chuckles.]
Well, they definitely wish  we were back together.
[both laughing.]
[R&B music playing.]
Sam, what's wrong?  Hmm? Nothing.
You're fiddling with your balls.
You do that when you're upset.
Now, who did this to you?  You know I can have anyone thrown in jail whenever I feel like it.
I don't even need a reason.
Oh, don't say stuff like that.
There was this one guy, innocent as a newborn baby.
I cuffed and stuffed him in the back of my car  just to see what would happen and I was not disappointed.
- Stop.
Stop stop it.
- [laughs.]
He pissed himself.
Stop talking.
No one did anything to me.
It's just  [whispering.]
I don't have anything for my dad's speech.
But you crush it every year.
Oh, I know.
You don't have to tell me.
Sam, you're fiddling with your balls.
What's wrong?  He's nervous about his speech.
Oh, hey, Molly.
Oink, oink.
I thought I smelled bacon.
I thought this was  a birthday party, not a pig roast.
Ah, it's so good to see you two.
- Yeah, you too.
- Where's your box of donuts?  Careful or I'll bust you for that crack in your pocket.
What crack in my pock  How in the hell did you do that?  - [both laughing.]
- How did you do that?  Okay, I've got something.
It's a bit of a Hail Mary  The ace up my sleeve, if you will.
I'm going next.
Wish me luck.
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine   You make me happy   When skies are gray   - Shit! -  You'll never know, dear   You were gonna sing "You Are My Sunshine"?  Our dad does love that song.
Please don't take my sunshine away   [applause.]
That was wonderful.
Thank you so much.
Now, some of you may remember that song  from the Coen Brothers' movie,  "O Brother Where Art Thou?"  based on Homer's "Odyssey".
Now, if I may quote the great Homer,  Let's hustle!  [cheers and applause.]
[funk music playing.]
[groovy music.]
Oh, boy, clown at a buffet.
[laughing.]
Here we go.
What?  I mean, that is kind of a lot of rice.
Is that a joke?  I'm just hungry.
You're not gonna get pie?  That's the funniest food here!  There's nothing funny about these pies.
I worked hard on them.
Oh, well, I'm sorry,  because by the end of the night,  these pies are gonna be flying around the room.
[laughs.]
You wasted your time, ma'am.
Hey, back off my wife, man.
Hey, back off my husband, man.
I'm just saying, there is a clown in the room.
These pies are toast.
- Shh.
- [people murmuring.]
You see how big he is and how small you are?  - Come on.
- Ho ho ho!  Mr.
Bones is gonna [bleep.]
these up.
Oh.
[groans.]
[drum roll.]
[grunts.]
[drum roll.]
[grunts.]
Ha!  [drum roll.]
[grunts.]
- [musical fanfare plays.]
- Ha ha ha ha ha!  - [applause.]
- I love you Uncle Lawrence.
[applause.]
David, you have a degree in economics.
[both laughing.]
Good job, baby.
I know, right? Beat that, Sam.
[laughs.]
David, you have no external sense of self.
You know what you need to do? Take off your shirt.
Paste some eyes on your nipples  and a mouth on your belly button.
Then take a giant top hat and put it  over your head and shoulders.
People love that.
That's a terrible idea.
[laughs.]
Never mind.
Don't do it.
Why not?  That guy's doing it right now.
[goofy music playing.]
[whistling.]
[laughter.]
He likes that?  [laughs.]
[laughter.]
[whistling.]
Hey, bud.
Your song was super cute.
Yeah, I know I was cute.
That's what I was going for.
Well, I was just trying to be nice.
- You want to be nice? - Yeah.
Why don't you go get me a few drinks?  That bitch waitress won't get me a beer.
It's probably 'cause you're seven.
Okay, sunburn.
We're done here.
- Oh.
- [laughs.]
You cover your ears.
Cover your ears.
You know what?  Santa Claus isn't real.
Oh yeah?  Then who gave me this huge hog?  [whispering.]
He asked Santa for a huge hog.
And he gave it to him.
[R&B music.]
I don't want nobody   Look at you.
He's more than just a father,  he's a friend.
I love you, Dad.
[speaking loudly.]
To the best father  in the whole wide world.
[applause.]
Well done.
Well done.
[applause.]
Uh, uh, do you mind if I say a few words here?  Does everybody remember when Mr.
Duvet had a mustache?  Yeah, of course we remember!  It's fresh in our mind.
I can hear It's a couple minutes of that.
Great, because, um, I'm not saying  Mr.
Duvet's mustache was big,  but if you turned him upside down,  he could be a push broom.
[laughter.]
And it even looked like a push broom too,  'cause it always had food in it.
[laughter.]
I mean, I've heard of a salt and pepper mustache,  but Mr.
Duvet's mustache  was salt and pepper and pickles and onions.
[laughter.]
I-I mean, you would see corn in his mustache,  be like, "Wait a minute, we haven't had corn in weeks".
[laughter.]
Look at that picture up there.
Is that Mr.
Duvet or did Cousin Itt  shave everything but his mustache?  [laughter.]
You are gonna make me throw up.
Mr.
Duvet doesn't have  the greatest mustache in the world.
He has the second-greatest only to Aunt Lacey!  [sighs.]
[laughs.]

That's my husband! That's my husband!  [laughter.]
All: Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim!  [laughter and applause.]
Oh! Now, ladies and gentlemen,  I would hate to have anybody try to follow that amazing speech.
Therefore  - Let's hustle! - Whoo!  - [funk music playing.]
- [all cheering.]
I can't believe you used all my jokes.
You threw 'em out.
That's before I knew they were gonna kill.
Hey, you talkin' or you doin' The Hustle?  You can't do both.
Sorry, Grandma.
I honestly have trouble doing both.
You were great up there.
I couldn't take my eyes off you.
Do you act?  No.
You should.
You got the body for it.
[giggles.]
You are a little gentleman.
What are you  Hey, pal, why don't you take  your little huge hog out of here?  - Jesus.
- Tim, he's a kid.
He's got the shit out of me.
Uh, Samuel.
Let me talk to you.
What is wrong?  I'm worried about my speech for Dad.
Oh, don't be.
You may not be funny like Tim or thoughtful like your sister,  but you are the cutest  little ladybug there ever was.
Hmm?  Mom, have you been drinking wine?  Oh, please.
Oh, look, there's Molly.
God, I love that girl.
Mr.
Duvet, my favorite piece of advice  you ever gave me was  to alwaysremain excited for the future.
All units, I've been hit! I need backup  [shuts off intercom.]
Tonight, as we celebrate all that you have been,  remember, we also celebrate all that you will be.
Happy birthday, Mr.
Duvet.
- [laughs.]
- [applause.]
[laughs.]
Now, that was a nice speech.
[laughs.]
Somebody ought to ask her to marry him!  Son, I'm referring to you.
Mom, I know.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
[laughs.]
You're gonna do a spit take, right?  [groovy music.]
[gulps.]
No spit take?  What kind of clown are you, man?  Look around, kid.
The only clown in this room is you.
Sam, am I a clown?  Tim, I'm really freaking out right now.
I mean, I've got nothing.
What am I gonna do?  Why are you stressed out about this?  You're always so good at things like this.
I mean, Tim, I could get up there  and I could tell jokes and sing a song  and get hands clapping and panties dropping.
This is a family event.
That's not what I what I want,  you know? Not tonight.
I just want to let my dad know how I feel about him.
You know, let him know that as I grow older,  I see myself becoming more and more like him,  and it just lets me know that I'm headed on the right path.
[toilet flushing.]
Samuel, that was perfect.
You projected wonderfully.
I could hear you all the way in the back of the bathroom.
[laughs.]
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, guys.
Oh, man, who stunk it up in here?  Well, I had an opportuni  I did.
I stunk it up in here.
With a poo.
Guys, check this out.
It stinks.
- Well - Ooh, whoa! Whoa!  - Uh, yeah, that's my poop.
- Hoo!  There's still poop in here.
Why didn't you flush?  He did flush.
He flushed five times,  but there was so much poop that it got stuck in the pipe.
It's all according to Sam.
Yeah, that's what happened.
Yeah.
And I pooped too.
You're also smelling my crap.
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.
My eyes don't cry no more   My heart don't ache no more   Since you walked through my door   I don't have to no longer be blue   You'll never know dear   How much I love you   And I do, Dad.
Please don't take   I said please don't take uh   Please don't take   I said please don't   Please don't   Take   Please don't take   My sun  Shine away hey-hey   [scattered applause.]
It's fine.
Hard to go second,  so, had the idea first.
[applause.]
Better than the kid.
Okay, now, if there are no more speeches  Julian.
Did you want to say something?  [laughing.]
All right.
Oh, boy.
Here comes Mr.
Bones.
Watch this, folks.
He is not performing tonight.
- Shh.
- Andrew Carnegie once said,  "As I grow older,  "I pay less attention to what men say.
I just watch what they do".
[crowd gasps.]
[laughs.]
Shit.
Classic!  He slow-played me, baby!  No, I don't know, Tim.
I think he's really hurt.
Oh, no, no, that was a clown fall.
[laughs.]
Oh.
You brilliant master of the comedic arts.
[majestic music.]
[groans.]
[inaudible.]
Yes!  In your face, pie lady!  - Oh! - [crowd gasps.]
[screams.]
[yelling.]

Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Just sit.
- Just come on.

- Just sit.
Just sit.
Just - [yelling.]
[yelling.]

The past and future happenings.
I am very happy  because today is my birthday.

Lea, I thought we kept telling you  to take us out in post.
And I kept telling you I can't do that.
Well, buckle up, everybody,  'cause we are not leaving this room  until we get this right.
- Oh, actually, it's 6:00.
- You can barely see us.
Let's put a pin in this till Monday morning.

You?  Yeah.
Oh, I just can't wait   Yeah, I'm  I'm having dinner with my best friend.
Let's do it.
Ah, but first,  I have to take a little trip  to the third floor.
Ah, the third floor.
Yes, old magic number three.
I take it the Browns are going to the Super Bowl?  Yeah.
I first have to, uh, drop the kids off at the pool  and then I'm going to, uh, crap in that pool.
Mm-hmm, and you're gonna do it in the lovely,  pristine, quiet majesty  - Yes.
- Of the third floor bathroom.
- Yes, of course.
- For your journey, sir.
- Thank you, my friend.
- Mm-hmm.
Have a fantastic poop.
[elevator dings.]
- Morning, Sheila.
- Morning, Sheila.
Morning, boys.
Lindsay of Lindsay's Mirror Depot called.
She wants to see the commercial.
Well, that would make three of us.
Shall we?  Uh, one minute.
The third floor is  calling my butthole's name.
Is it, uh  [high-pitched voice.]
Oh, Frederick!  [Southern accent.]
Why, who is it?  It's the third floor.
Well, I declare,  I'm coming to poop on you.
[both giggling.]
Actually, poop and pee.
I got to do both.
I I'm talking as Sam now.
I don't know what you're doing.
Yeah, no, it's me.
It's Sam.
Oh.
Well, if you're traveling,  you are going to need your suitcase.
Why, thank you, my good man.
Of course.
[exhales.]
Did you get outside this weekend, or did you?    The phone lines are off,  so distribute the extension list  and Wi-Fi password.
Also, make sure everybody  breaks down their empty cardboard boxes for recycling.
[eerie music.]
[high-pitched tone.]
[heavy breathing.]
Tim.
It's over.
It's over.
The third floor is over.
Sam, slow down.
What are you talking about?  [stammering.]
So okay, so I went downstairs  to poop, and then, uh You I went downstairs.
There's a bunch of people, and there's there's  - a business down there, and - You sped up.
- You sped up.
- [stammering.]
A password  Sam, slow down.
What's wrong?  We can't poop on the third floor anymore.
Take it back.
What the hell?  [choking.]
Take it back.
[both struggling.]
Stop trying to kill me.
You're frickin' stronger than me.
Who cares?  [suspenseful music.]
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   [elevator dinging.]
Ned, red alert.
Yo, Tim, Sam.
My favorite ad guys.
Oh! Got a commercial for you.
Campbell's Soup: it's just wet-ass food.
Not now, Ned.
There are intruders in the building.
No, that's that new tech company.
They just moved in.
They're pretty cool.
Moved in? As in full-time?  Yeah.
They're legit too.
They're doing all these renovations.
Like, they're fixing stuff up.
Right upstairs with that.
Oh, while I got you guys here,  I want to get your pictures, 'cause everybody has to get  these new ID badges now.
- Are you serious? - Do we even get lanyards?  Cheese.
[camera shutter clicking.]
Oh, those shoulders.
And that neck.
Thanks, Ned.
Jesus Christ, that neck.
Bye, Tim.
What the  [elevator dinging.]
Hold the door.
Thanks.
Sorry.
You rode your bike, huh?  DUI?  No, it's just good exercise,  good for the environment.
[dramatic music.]
- You guys are up on four? - Yeah.
Tim Cramblin, Cramblin-Duvet Advertising.
Been in the building for decades.
Many decades, hundreds of years.
Sam Duvet.
I'm his best friend, also co-boss.
Toby Hart, DTC.
We're a tech company out of Denver,  and we are super excited  to be moving our headquarters here to Detroit.
Didn't even have to change the D.
[laughs.]
What sort of techs do you do?  Automated customer communication.
Basically, we want to do for the service repair industry  what Home Depot did for hammers and nails.
Oh.
[elevator dings.]
Third floor.
See you around, neighbors.
[elevator door closes.]
That guy sucks, right?  Tip to tail, piece of shit.
But new tech company is good for the city.
It's good for the city.
Good for the city.
[elevator dinging.]
I mean I think hammers did more for Home Depot  than Home Depot did for hammers.
Right? I mean, like, how do you even build  a Home Depot without the hammer?  - Right? - Right?  Let's go check in with Lea.
Uh, you go ahead, my good man.
But I still have a stinky little Santa Claus up my butt,  and the only chimney is behind Sheila's desk.
Aw.
[sighs.]
Hello, Sheila.
Sam.
Uh, you want to maybe go get a coffee?  No, I'm just fine.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, maybe you want to go get a cof  Uh, like, a tea?  Maybe, like, a smoothie?  I'm fine.
Can you please leave your desk for a little bit?  Why?  Why?  Fine.
Where are we on this?  [upbeat music.]
We have round mirrors,  wall mirrors,  rectangle mirrors.
It's getting there.
It's getting there.
Can we just zoom in here,  pull this out, stretch it,  then digitalize it?  No.
We're close.
What does "digitalize" mean?  We're close!  [toilet flushes.]
I'm not gonna apologize for that, Sheila.
- It's fine.
- All right, look.
I don't like it any more than you do, okay?  But that's just the world we're living in.
I said it's fine.
If we don't poop, we die, Sheila.
Is Sheila refusing to poop again?  [phone ringing.]
You've got Lindsay on line one!  Hey, Lindsay, you're on with Tim and Sam.
- This is Tim.
- This is Sam.
Hi, guys.
Now, and  And when can I see the commercial?  'Cause it was due last Friday.
Lindsay, this is Tim.
I thought we said this Friday.
No, no, we said last Friday.
Ah, Lindsay, this is Sam.
Let's go ahead and chalk that up to a miscommunication.
Lindsay, this is Tim.
Yeah, we bungled that on our end,  but we'll definitely have  something to show you by this Friday.
Lindsay, Sam.
Yeah, we want to make sure  that thing's absolutely perfect for you, okay?  Boys, this is Sheila.
We lost Lindsay.
Sheila, this is Tim.
Can we try and get Lindsay back on the line?  Tim, Sheila.
I'm working on it.
Sheila, this is Sam.
Thank you, Sheila.
That was pretty good.
No, it was not.
No, it definitely wasn't.
Yeah, I'll send a follow-up email  to Lindsay when I get home.
Oh, you don't have to.
You can send it from here now, actually.
Yeah, those buttmunches on three  installed fiber-optic Wi-Fi for the whole building.
Now grab your perfect little pecker and start  - What's that? - It's a JOI video.
It's jerk-off instructions.
They tell you how to jerk off?  They tell you why to jerk off.
We really are living in the future.
Grab your private area and yank.
You know, as much as I hate that DTC took away our bathroom  and made us get security badges,  they haven't been all that bad for the building.
Oh, I couldn't agree more.
You know, I say, welcome, DTC.
Oh, come on!  "Saving Detroit"?  Oh, eat shit.
You eat shit, asshole!  Tim, not you.
Them.
Oh.
Yeah, eat shit!    "The new face of the Motor City"?  I'm honestly mad, and I don't get mad.
- You don't.
You get even.
- I do.
Smug son of a bitch has been here one week.
They're on the cover of a magazine?  We've been here our entire lives.
We've never been on the cover of a magazine.
Well, "Chubby Buddies.
"  [gentle piano music.]
Yeah, "Chubby Buddies.
"  [mumbles.]
You hungry?  I'm starving.
Let's get something to eat.
"Saving Detroit.
"  They're not even from Detroit.
We're from Detroit.
No, I'm from Detroit.
You're from suburbs.
Don't say that anymore.
You can't just waltz into the city and claim it as your own.
Yeah, you can't just throw on a Tigers cap,  eat a Coney dog, and all of a sudden you're Kid Rock.
- He's from the suburbs too.
- Come on.
[elevator dings.]
Why are we stopping?  Hey, Sam, Tim.
Toby.
This is Abigail.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
You work in the building too?  Uh, yeah, we do.
For hundreds of years, right?  That's a stupid joke.
I don't like that joke anymore.
[deep voice.]
We're on the fourth floor.
Oh, hey, Toby,  I just wanted to personally thank you  for saving our city.
Yeah, thanks for reaching into the garbage  and pulling us out.
Oh, you guys saw the magazine thing.
That is so embarrassing.
But you know, whatever helps the business.
- Mm-hmm.
- Saving Detroit.
I guess we're gonna have to start wearing capes to work.
[laughing.]
Hey, we're gonna do a pedal pub at 6:00 tonight.
Should be supes fun.
It's a bar on wheels  that you pedal around.
You guys want to join?  A pedal pub?  Ah, we can't.
We're buried too deep  under the ashes of our smoldering city.
[chuckles.]
You're funny, Tim.
Actually, I'm not.
Sam's the funny one.
Well, when I have time to prepare.
Hey, we were gonna have lunch at a place on Gratiot.
Is that a safe area?  Yeah, it's a safe area.
This is Detroit, not a third world country.
It says it's only a 12-minute walk.
- Both: Walk? - Are you insane?  Absolutely take a car.
Absolutely.
Just keep your heads above ya, you know what I mean?  Look up.
Stay off your phone.
Thanks for the tip.
We have round mirrors,  wall mirrors,  rectangle mirrors.
No.
See, that doesn't work.
I've checked every frame of footage twice.
This is the closest thing we have  to a clean shot of a mirror.
I can still see Sam in it.
You know, uh, in the end, what you're gonna want to do  is digitalize it.
That's not a real thing.
You keep saying that.
Well, we have a lot of work to do,  and we are fresh out of tomorrows,  so we're gonna have to work late tonight.
Oh, you know what? Actually, I  I think I'm just gonna go home.
I'm yeah, I'm not feeling too hot, so  How many hot dogs you have for lunch?  - Three.
- Well, there's your problem.
You're starving.
Your body's literally eating itself.
Let me see if I have any emergency dogs in my desk.
- I bet I do.
- Actually, you know what, pal?  That's okay.
I'll just see you tomorrow.
- You sure? - Yeah, sure.
- All right, feel better.
- Thanks, pal.
- Sam? - Uh-huh?  I love you and I trust you.
[chuckles.]
Sam.
I hate it when it's just the two of us.
Why?  Not as fun.
Yeah, well, your breath stinks.
Why don't you try flipping that?  Flip the front and the back.
Spirit Airlines: dying while flying.
Night, Ned.
Night, Tim.
Oh, try   Oh, try me and see   If you don't believe   [people laughing and cheering.]
All you have to do is just try me   Whoo!  DTC.
[people cheering.]
Sam Duvet!    [people cheering.]
This is so much fun.
When do we stop? Soon?  [laughs.]
You're so funny.
We just got started.
We've got another two hours!  [all cheering.]
Oh, no.
[chuckles.]
I'm  mad!    Bologna: because it's all the meats.
[exhales.]
[elevator dinging.]
Yeah, don't hold the door.
I said, don't hold the [bleep.]
door!  [elevator dinging.]
[soft instrumental music.]
Morning, Sheila.
Good morning, Sam.
Oh!  Well, there he is.
The man of the hour.
Good news, buddy.
I was, uh, talking to Abigail,  and she said that the DTC  [groans.]
Can, uh, actually help us  with the mirror commercial.
Yeah.
Mm, mm.
Uh, she said that they could, uh, digitalize it.
Huh.
No shit.
I knew that was a thing.
DTC to the rescue again.
They should start wearing capes to work.
[laughing loudly.]
Capes.
[laughing.]
Capes.
That's funny.
[chuckles.]
Yeah.
Are we really doing this?  Yeah, we're doing it.
Doing what?  Oh, Sam.
I was just so gutted yesterday  that you felt down  because we'd been working so hard,  so I went ahead and rented us  one of those supes fun pedal pubs.
You did?  Is there a problem, Samuel?  No.
No?  You're good to ride?  Not sore for some reason?  Nope.
Great.
I'm just glad to have my buddy back.
[groans, chuckles.]
So let's get up and get out there.
- Come on, my friend.
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.
- Let's hit the road.
I'm gonna hit the road.
I'm so happy about it,  I'm gonna just kind of laugh on my way up.
- [chuckles.]
- [pained laughing.]
Fun, isn't it?  It sure is.
And it's even more fun  that we're doing it for the first time together.
Sure is, pal.
What's wrong?  You seem a little tired, old friend.
- I do? - Yeah.
I don't feel tired.
You want to talk about tired?  Sheila's barely even pedaling.
That just means more exercise  for the two of us, old pal.
Right, old buddy.
I mean, we could stop at any time.
You do hate exercise.
You know, I used to hate exercise,  and then all of a sudden, as if by magic,  I decided to love it  without telling my best friend.
[strained laughter.]
Where are you guys going?  To a bar that doesn't move.
And then there were two.
Then there were.
[rock music.]
You were feeling sick last night.
How'd you recover so quick?  I just went right home and went straight to bed.
I saw you!  You were on the bike pub with DTC!  Fine, I lied!  And you know what? They're not that bad.
Not that bad?  They're just pretending to be from Detroit.
Who cares?  They're not going anywhere.
They're here now.
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you lie to me about it?  Because, Tim, sometimes  you always get mad about everything.
No, I don't!  What would you have said if I told you I wanted  to cut out of work early to go ride pedal pubs  'cause I liked some girl?  I'd have choked you out!  I'd have blocked you!  You like some girl?  Yeah, Abigail.
Why didn't you just tell me this before?  Why couldn't you have said all this back at the office?  'Cause this honestly looked fun to me.
I didn't know you would have to pedal.
I know.
Who wants to pedal a bike  while you slug these bad boys?  I really just want to sit back and slug beers.
That's all I want to  And we're getting on the highway.
Oh, crap!  [both screaming.]
[horns honking.]
We're gonna die!  - [shouting indistinctly.]
- Yeah, back at ya!  Hey, Lindsay, this is Tim.
Did you get a chance to see the commercial?  I loved it.
The mirrors were gorgeous.
Hey, Lindsay, this is Tim.
Glad you liked how gorgeous they were.
How'd you make 'em so gorgeous?  Ah, Lindsay, this is Sam.
I can speak to that.
We had a tech company digitalize it.
- It's brilliant.
- Go ahead and run it.
[both mouthing words.]
Guys?  Are you guys there?  Tim?  Sam?  Linds, this is Tim.
Will do.
Till next time.
Bye-bye.
[phone beeps.]
Boom.
Ba-da bing, Ba-da boom.
It's easy peasy.
You and me, forget about it.
Everybody knows.
Whew.
- Oh, Christ! - Oh, yeah.
[groaning.]
My legs.
There you go.
Back in, back in.
- Oh.
- Put your little legs up.
Yeah.
Hey.
Sorry I made you do back-to-back pedal pubs.
Sorry I brilliantly deceived you  and, uh, so I could do the first one.
Yeah, no worries.
It's actually pretty fun to do it.
Yeah, it actually is really fun.
I had a great time.
I would honestly  take out the drinking.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
- I don't even - Oh, Frick!  - Oh, Christ! - Come on.
[screaming.]
[elevator dinging.]
Hey, Tim, Sam.
Hey.
[clears throat.]
I just wanted to thank you guys  for helping us out on our commercial.
No problem.
Always have time to help a fellow Detroiter.
Hey, uh, tonight we're going "fowling,"  which is like a It's like football and bowling,  - kind of like - That sounds really fun.
My boyfriend would love that.
Nope, we can't.
We got to work, so  You just invited us.
That's not how I remember it.
You can come if you'd like, though.
[elevator dinging.]
both: Why are we stopping?  [upbeat music.]
Detroit Belts?  They're actually from Seattle.
Hey, Toby.
[whispering.]
It's good for the city.
[deep voice.]
So what's your name?   Fat mirrors,  thin mirrors,  glass mirrors,  itty-bitty cat mirrors,  weird mirrors.
Please come and take a look at our mirrors  and yourself in one of our mirrors.

--- S01E07 ---
1 [hip-hop music.]
Doughnut!    It goes one for the struggle   Two for the muscle cars   Three for the trouble   [music stops.]
- Tim! - That's on me.
- That's on me.
- Oh, Lord.
Hey, guys.
Thank y'all for letting me use the copier.
You needed that many copies?  No, I only made three copies, man.
The rest of this printer paper's for my house.
[laughs.]
Y'all coming to the show?  We wouldn't miss it, Doughnut.
See you there, Doughnut.
- Doughnut! - [laughter.]
Yeah, y'all gonna need more paper, man.
All right, no pressure.
Stop it.
- No pressure.
- Stop.
You know, when you say "no pressure,"  it just adds pressure.
I honestly don't mean it like that, though.
- I know you don't, bud.
- You're my best friend.
You're my best friend.
Irv and Doris Smith are here to see you.
They don't have an appointment.
It's no worry, Sheila.
You can send them in.
Aw, Irv and Doris Smith.
What an unexpected pleasure.
Can we get you anything?  No, no, no.
Thank you, dear.
Well, you're getting this hug.
I can tell you that.
Come on.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
So what can we do  for Smith's Baby and Teen Kid Furniture?  Boys, we have to let you go.
[somber music.]
It's not you.
It's nothing you've done.
It's just that, I mean, we don't have the  We have  We have to prioritize our finances.
I see.
Uh [chuckles.]
This is some very unexpected news.
Uh, please allow me a moment to process it.
[whimpering.]
We just can't afford to advertise.
We can't.
I mean, the business is  We have to prioritize our finances.
I don't know what that means, Irv.
Boys, don't make this any harder than it already is.
Please don't do this.
I will get revenge on you.
Are you threatening me?  We're gonna bury you and your crap store.
Please take us back.
We can change.
Oh, when we're done with you,  people are gonna laugh  when they hear the name  Smith's Baby and Teen Kid Furniture.
They'll laugh.
- Let's go, Doris.
- Yeah, go!  Go on, get out of here.
Who needs you?  Please don't do this, Irv.
I'm sorry.
We've made our decision.
Okay.
Okay, great.
Good riddance.
We'll see you guys around, okay?  - Good-bye, boys.
- Yeah, good-bye.
I hope the elevator falls as you get in  and it chops you in half.
Tim.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   [soft music.]
Bet it's just a mistake.
I bet Irv and Doris call us tomorrow  and ask us to come back.
I wouldn't go back to them  if Irv pleasured me orally.
Or maybe we go to them  and beg them to take us back,  you know, tell them we'll work for free.
I wouldn't work for them if Irv pleasured me orally.
- You keep saying that.
- Oh, sorry.
Yeah, it's just 'cause of that billboard up there.
Smilin' Jack.
What amateur put him on a billboard with his mouth open?  [laughs.]
I mean, every ad might as well come  with a stepladder and a giant can of spray paint.
Smilin' Jack is Irv and Doris's  number one competitor in furniture.
He sells furniture?  Yeah, lookit, right by the pubes.
You see it says "furniture"?  Oh.
He'd be a great client.
- Irv would be so pissed.
- [laughs.]
[funky music.]
[elegant piano music playing.]
I have never eaten here before.
This is really, really nice.
Well, only the best for our client.
I'm not your client just yet.
[laughter.]
Well, we'll see about that.
[laughter.]
Can I start you gentlemen with something to drink?  Oh, here we go.
I'm good with just water.
You sure? The bar has everything.
Oh, no, no, thanks.
No, I don't drink.
Do you mind if we drink?  No, no, no, of course not.
- Oh.
- [laughs.]
So, like, I almost started to tear up.
Oh, my God, I fricking crapped my pants.
Yeah, man, I'm like, "Oh, no.
"  Yeah, "What am I gonna do here?"  I'll have a double bourbon and a Vernors.
I'll have a giant glass boot filled with beer.
I'm sorry.
We don't have that.
Well, then your bar doesn't have everything.
Sam.
You know, I really I hate to waste your time,  but I'm really not looking to do more advertising right now.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, no.
Okay? I'm so sorry.
Yeah, no worries.
I hear that.
Okay, that gives me a certain amount of relief.
- Definitely hear that.
- Thank you.
How you feeling?  I'm in the sweet spot,  not too drunk, not too sober.
Me, too, baby.
Let's go in for the kill.
You got it, pal.
Jack, you're known all over town as the guy  with a dick in his mouth.
Well  it's not just dicks.
- No, it's not.
- It's not.
- I've seen boobs.
- Yes.
- I've seen poop.
- I have too.
I've seen a butt pooping boobs.
- Yup, yup.
- I've seen Andre the Giant.
I've seen that.
Don't get it, but I've seen it.
And let's not forget about the speech bubbles.
- Yup, yup.
- "I'm hungry for turds.
"  That's right by my church.
- "I'm thirsty for dongs.
" - Mm-hmm.
"Feed me wieners.
"  Do you think it's just one guy?  No, Jack.
But we at Cramblin-Duvet  can put an end to all that nonsense  by rebranding you  in a television commercial.
To be honest, the billboards don't really bother me, okay?  I actually I think they're kind of funny.
You know what I mean?  Young man, I know what you're doing.
You're busted.
Yeah, that's great.
You're using forced perspective  to make it look like I'm fellating that bread stick.
Grow up.
Grow up.
Oh, and there we go.
Dinner roll balls.
Dinner roll balls, really original.
You know what? I am tired of this.
Sign me up.
Let's do this.
- All right.
- Oh, man, okay.
Champagne of beers.
You've already had five drinks each.
- Just bring them! - What's your problem, man?  Oh, I am really excited right now.
- This feels good.
- It's gonna be great, Jack.
Whoo!  [laughs.]
[soft music.]
[laughter.]
You guys, uh  Are you guys okay to drive?  Drive? I'm not okay to walk.
[laughter.]
Okay, well, come on.
I'll give you a ride.
- Thank you so much.
- Shotgun!  - Oh, come on.
- Here you go, buddy.
Thanks.
[laughs.]
You guys heading back to the office?  Yeah, but we need to make  a little stop somewhere along the way.
- Okay.
- Oh, sweet.
Oh, what the future holds for me   Yeah   Hello, Doris, Irv.
We just landed a little account that we like to call  Smilin' Jack's Furniture.
It's the premier adult furniture store in town.
And not porno furniture.
He doesn't mean that.
No, I mean furniture for adults,  the big time, the show.
We met at a conference once.
- Yes, Jack.
- Of course.
How's your mother, dear? How's her hip?  It's really nice of you to remember.
She's back on her feet again,  just trying to keep those damn squirrels  out of her bird feeder.
[laughter.]
Enough!  What are you doing here, Irv?  Construction dude, blueprints.
I thought you had to prioritize your finances.
Yes, we're using our entire advertising budget  to build a giant bunk bed on the roof.
We think that will raise awareness of the store.
How big a bunk bed we talking about?  - 30 feet.
- [whistles.]
- Oh, cool.
- Whoa.
Stupid.
It's too big.
Come on, Sam.
We got a lot of work to do.
We wish you boys nothing but the best of luck.
And we hope your store burns down.
No, we don't.
And the fire department can't find a fire hydrant,  so they have to put the fire out with piss!  Tim, come on.
You really think a giant bunk bed's  gonna be better than one of our commercials?  I guess I do.
[scoffs.]
Guys, I really got to get back to the store.
See you around, Irv.
See you, Doris.
Say it meaner.
[gruffly.]
See you, Doris.
[laughs.]
Best of luck to you guys,  and I'll say hi to my mother for you.
[bleep.]
[bleep.]
!  Whoo!  A bunk bed.
We've been replaced by a bunk bed.
We need an idea.
Oh, I got it.
What if he has a pumpkin head  and he's Smilin' Jack-o'-Lantern?  Tim, that's your third Halloween idea so far.
Oh, what if he's a wolf man,  and he's always howling about low prices?  You know, I don't think we should draw attention  - to what his mouth is doing.
- It's just his head.
- You don't see his mouth.
- How does he talk?  You're a fricking brick wall tonight.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I'm sorry.
There's no bad ideas.
A spooky skeleton.
Ooh.
[laughs.]
What?  What if [laughs.]
What do you got?  Is this my wolf man idea?  No, Tim.
Let me get this down.
Oh.
- Oh, wow.
- [laughs.]
- And then this.
- Oh, my  Oh, that is cute!  - [laughs.]
- This is cute!  - Yup! - Mm-hmm.
Yes!  Yes, Sam!  What if a witch flies in?  - No, Tim.
- Put it in!  - I'm not.
- Sam  this might be your masterpiece.
[upbeat music.]
This is funny.
Really good, guys.
And the end is really sweet.
- Yeah.
- Just it's a lot to remember.
You are going to be fine.
All you have to do is, you are gonna step over here,  and you're gonna say, "My furniture is so nice,  when you see it, you'll pop.
"  Then you're gonna pop one of these balloons.
Then you say, "My selection is so wide,  you'll go off your rocker.
"  Then grandma flips backwards off the rocker.
Then you head over here, and you'll say,  "When you see my prices, you'll go ape,"  and then in comes the ape,  and we're gonna see a little more energy from the ape.
A lot more.
And then it goes on and on from there.
You'll for sure get Oh, one thing.
- Yeah.
- When you smile  - Keep my lips closed.
- That's right.
He's got it.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Chrissy.
- Sam.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, babe.
I just wanted to stop by and wish you luck.
- Thank you so much.
- I'm gonna go home and change.
But don't forget, tonight's Doughnut's show.
Oh, yeah, I will be there.
Tim, tonight means a lot to Doughnut.
Promise me you'll make it.
I promise you that I will be there.
We'll both be there.
Nobody cares if you're there.
You're flat as a board, and everyone knows it.
- Sam.
I'll be there.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Good luck, everybody.
Smith's Baby and Teen Kid Furniture  can suck my dick.
All right, everybody, let's shoot one.
Smilin' Jack Furniture, take one.
And action.
My furniture is so nice,  when you see it, you'll pop.
My selection is so wide,  you'll go off your rocker.
And my prices are so low,  you'll go ape.
Scheisse.
Cut.
- Hey, Jack.
- Mm-hmm?  - Are you okay? - Yes.
[laughs.]
Oh, God, yes.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry, guys.
I just I got a little scared.
There was a an ape was barreling down on me,  and you just go on the defensive, you know?  - Yeah, that's okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
You had never seen him with the head on.
As a matter of fact, Mike,  maybe put the head on so Jack can see you with it?  That's not necessary.
I'm not stupid.
I'm not an idiot, okay?  I can see that he's not a real ape.
- Yeah.
- So, uh  [laughs.]
Can we just go again?  - Yup.
Uh, you sure? - Yeah.
I am sure.
I'm 100% sure, yes.
I'm sorry, everybody.
Smilin' Jack, take two.
And action.
My furniture is so nice,  when you see it, you'll pop,  and my selection is so wide,  you'll go off your rocker.
My prices are so low,  you'll go ape.
Holy shit!  - Cut.
- Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
That's me.
Let's just go again, please.
That's the last time.
This is the last time, I promise.
I promise.
That's embarrassing.
Boy, oh, boy.
[laughs.]
Smilin' Jack, take three.
My prices are so low,  you'll go ape.
No, don't.
Take four.
My prices are so low  that you'll go ape.
[exhales deeply.]
- [screams.]
- Cut.
Oh!  Smilin' Jack Furniture, take 17.
It's not a real ape.
It is not a real ape.
[bleep.]
.
You'll go ape.
Take 42.
You'll go ape.
- [screams.]
- Cut.
Guys, that's a natural reaction.
Come on, Jack.
Get it together!  How are you getting more scared?  Guys, I'm sorry.
Hey, listen.
Maybe we can just, um, lose the ape part  and skip straight to the gymnast who's flipping over my prices.
We can't just lose the ape part, Jack.
I mean, you can't go from grandma to gymnast.
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean, am I crazy?  No, you're not.
The script is not the problem here.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, okay.
- No, no, no.
Hey, look, why don't we just take a break?  We'll regroup, and we'll calm down.
I'm calm.
- We've done 42 takes.
- Yeah.
We're not even close.
We're gonna miss Doughnut's show.
Maybe we should just simplify it.
No way.
Right now, the Smiths are sitting  on their giant bunk bed, and they're laughing at us.
This next take is the one.
I can feel it, Sam.
He's ready.
[screams.]
He's ready.
Detroit, show your love  for Doughnut Perkins.
What's going on, y'all?  How y'all feeling, huh?  [laughs.]
That's right.
Doughnut!  [laughs.]
You know what drives me crazy, y'all,  is nerdy white guys who marry black women.
Am I right?  I mean, look at this nerdy white guy right here.
Uh  [stammers.]
[whispering.]
Chrissy, where's Tim?  - He had to work.
- What?  He was my whole set.
I'm sorry, Doughnut.
Uh  uh, moving on, y'all.
Doughnut! [laughs.]
You ever so basically, um  - Did I miss it? - Yes, you missed it.
I am so sorry, Doughnut.
You should be, man.
I was counting on you, Tim.
I'm never gonna forgive you for this.
You either, Sam.
What'd I do, Doughnut?  [sighs.]
Can we have two Downrivers, please?  The body was found dead in an apartment  the FBI is claiming belonged to the real Santa Claus.
More after these messages.
Smith's Baby and Teen Kid Furniture  is the only place you need to go  for your teens and babies.
I said babies, Irv, not babes.
Smith's Baby and Teen Kid Furniture.
Ask for Irv and Doris Smith.
We'll be here.
Aw.
We shot that commercial in one take.
Then Irv and Doris had us over to their house for dinner.
I miss them so much.
Why did they do this to us?  [bluesy music.]
Guys  I don't want to run the ad.
Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing  is turning out like pure crap.
Thank you for saying that.
I can't imagine what else it could be.
Yeah.
Oh, whew!  It's okay, though.
It's okay.
You know, what we can do for you is,  we can set you up with some new billboards.
Guys, I don't want to do the billboards either.
Advertising, it's  it's brought me nothing  but pain and embarrassment.
I  [sighs.]
Look, I think we should just go our separate ways.
[laughing.]
Un be lievable.
I mean, first, you ruin our perfect commercial.
- Yeah.
- Then you fire us?  Ooh, I want to bounce your head  against every glass window in this place!  Listen, fellas, fellas, I think we all know  that this wasn't working out.
All that means is that we need to try harder.
Tim, I just think I think it's over, okay?  Welcome back.
Are you ready to order?  - Is this on you? - Of course.
All right, then I guess I'll just have a surf and turf.
Yeah, I'll do the surf and turf as well.
Yeah, and the calamari to split.
Can we get mozz sticks with all the dips?  Yeah, and then maybe a bowl of pasta to split for the table.
Do you get bread sticks with the dips?  And a triple bourbon and a Vernors  and an arancini ball.
What is that?  It's, like, an Italian rice dish,  sometimes with mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese too, yeah.
Yeah, we'll take that one too,  please, with a little dip.
- And for you, sir? - Oh, I'll just share with them.
This guy.
Can you believe it?  [yelling.]
Can you fricking believe it?  Shh, calm down, Sam.
[funky music.]
Now that I've had time to process it,  I'm not even mad anymore.
Nah, Smilin' Jack's a piece of shit.
- [chuckles.]
What a week.
- Yeah.
You know what would make me feel good right about now?  Going to see a giant 30-foot-high bunk bed  on top of a baby and teen kid furniture store?  - Exactly that.
- Let's do it.
Sam, Tim, hello.
How's it going?  Not too good.
Turns out nobody cares about our giant bunk bed.
30 feet seems big until you put it  way up there on top of the roof.
This was supposed to be just the first step in a grand plan.
Doris had the idea to have two inflatable teens  getting into the bunk bed.
- Preteens, dear.
- Sorry, preteens.
Beautiful, beautiful preteens.
You know, fuzz above the boy's lip  and gorgeous, innocent faces just covered in zits.
Best part  we were gonna have a pump attached to the boy's crotch.
You know, teen boys just can't control it.
Now, it's not that he likes his sister in that way.
It's just that, well, they do share a bedroom,  and things get confusing.
Now it's never gonna happen.
Boys, would you like to hear  the world's saddest nine-word novel?  For sale,  shoes for two inflatable preteens,  never used.
Boys, will you take us back?  Only if you'll have us, Irv.
Oh!  [soft piano music.]
Would you boys like to come over for dinner tonight?  Actually, there's someplace we'd like to take you.
[sniffling.]
Oh.
You know what drive me crazy  is nerdy white guys that marry black women.
Am I right?  Look at this nerdy white guy right here.
Oh, his black wife cook him collard greens,  he's like, "Oh, thank you for the green beans.
"  [laughter.]
Old small-ass dick.
His wedding day, he was like, "I do.
"  His wedding night, he was like, "Uh, I'm in.
"  [laughter.]
What was your first dance, the Macarena?  [laughter.]
[mouthing words.]
Old dumbass white boy.
[laughter.]
Doughnut!  Whoo!  Oh, shit, there's two old white people.
- Oh! - Oh!  Can somebody tell me what the "Titanic" was like?  [laughter.]
Doughnut!  Doughnut.

1 [bright music.]
Good morning, Detroit.
Get your hot rods ready because this weekend  is the famous Woodward Dream Cruise.
Our own Harvey Bart is spending the day  soaking up all the action.
Let's see how he's doing.
Harvey.
Good morning, Nadine.
Well, somebody pinch me 'cause I am  definitely dreaming down here at the Dream Cruise.
So many fun people,  so many great cars all driving  up and down the street like they do here every year.
So much fun.
Not much else is happening,  just people driving up and down the street.
We're gonna cut you off right there.
Thanks, Harvey.
Later in the hour,  celebrity chef Margaret Peretti  will join us to show us how to make  some fun '50s-inspired dishes  as well as apologize  for her now-infamous  anti-Semitic rant from last week.
But first, we have with us two local admen  who started their own T-shirt company.
Tim Cramblin and Sam Duvet, welcome.
Thanks for having us on the show, Nadine.
We watch you all the time.
Oh, Thanks.
Now  Not not like in a stalker way  'cause, you know  Not like a person who's, like, obsessed.
- Chill out.
- Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
- Don't touch her.
- I won't.
It's not  Tell us about the T-shirts.
Well, it seems like everywhere you go these days,  you see T-shirts with Detroit slogans on them.
Psh, you said it, Tim.
You may be familiar with "Detroit vs.
Everybody.
"  Just the best.
And "Detroit Hustles Harder.
"  You can't beat it.
You sure can't, which is why  we're proud to present to you  our very own T-shirt, "De-two-roit.
"  And we'd like to thank our crew members  Lea and Tommy Pencils  for modeling our "De-two-roit" T-shirts today.
Uh, take it easy on Tommy.
He's a little nervous.
He's not used to being in front of the camera for a change.
Well, I got to be honest, guys.
I don't get it.
It looks like you put a 2  where the T should be.
Uh, no, not looks like.
That's what we did.
Yeah, so now it's "De-two-roit.
"  "De-two-roit.
"  But why?  - Well - Asking  That can best be explained by a freestyle rap  performed by Lea and Tommy Pencils.
Sounds like fun.
Lea, Tommy Pencils, take it away.
If you're in the market for a cool T-shirt   Uh uh  If you're in the market for a cool T-shirt   Is this live?  Yes, this is live.
But on a commercial break.
Why don't we move on?  - No, he can do it.
- Yeah, lead him in again, Lea.
If you're in the market for a cool T-shirt   Uh uh  - Tommy? - Oh, oh, oh, oh!  - Oh, no! - Oh, my goodness.
[laughs.]
Assholes.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   [elevator dings.]
Morning, Sheila.
Where you going?  [coughs weakly.]
I don't feel well.
I'm going to go home and lay down.
[doo-wop music.]
Then why are you dressed like a Pink Lady?  Are you going to the Woodward Dream Cruise?  Oh, is that today?  All right, well, have fun.
I mean feel better.
They bought it.
Heard her.
She said it out loud.
I heard you, bud.
- There she is.
- How's the gam, Lea?  The doctor says our insurance lapsed  because you two haven't been paying the premiums.
Lea, insurance is for suckers and for chumps.
- Everybody knows that.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, this is how much you owe.
- Ooh.
- [scoffs.]
That's ridiculous.
Lea, if we had that much money,  this place would be wall-to-wall pinball machines.
And a skee ball machine for exercise.
- Mm-hmm.
- Reactivate the insurance,  or I'm gonna have to quit and get another job.
You know, I really hate to pile on here,  but if Lea goes, I go.
Who the hell are you, man?  I worked here 30 years.
Your dad hired me, and I stand with Lea.
If you lose her, you lose me.
I don't even know you.
We didn't even know you were here.
All's I'm saying is, if Lea goes, then I go.
Go.
[melancholy music.]
Well, I'm sorry it had to end like this.
Okay, Lea, let's go.
What? I'm not leaving.
Okay, well, uh, I guess I'm leaving.
Who's coming with me?  Anybody?  Sam?  Psh, buddy, no way.
Very well.
Oh, thanks for having our backs on that, Lea.
Well, that settles that.
- Everything's not settled.
- Okay, look.
We'll find the money.
Just give us a week.
A month would be great.
I'll give you till 5:00 tonight,  or I'm gonna walk out of here just like Wallace.
- Who's Wallace? - Who the hell is Wallace?  I'm Wallace!  - Get out of here, man! - Jesus, man, just go!  [sighs.]
- We'll find the money, Lea.
- Trust us.
[hip-hop music.]
If you're in the market   For a cool T-shirt   A "De-two-roit" one couldn't hurt   Now he can do it.
I mean, Tommy, we love ya,  but you're too little, too late.
Yeah, and I wouldn't fall asleep tonight.
- You may have a concussion.
- You definitely do.
- Still? - Yeah, man.
Okay, I made a list  of every client that owes us money.
Do we really have to do this?  It's so uncomfortable.
Yes, we do.
It's for Lea.
She's like family.
You're right.
Let's do this.
Well, I don't think you need that bat.
I don't think you need those knuckles.
Oh, these knuckles?  [tense music.]
Put it down first.
You put yours down first.
Both: Same time.
All right, let's go.
All right, first up, Devereux Wigs.
Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
Ooh, Devereux   Devereux Wigs.
We guarantee our wigs  are no longer made from hair off dead bodies.
Rhonda Devereux is the devil!    [crowd yelling.]
Money? I can't pay you any money.
No one's bought a wig since they found out  we used hair from dead bodies.
You're a monster!  I don't use dead people hair anymore.
[crowd yelling.]
Who's the monster?  Me for shaving the hair off corpses  or the rest of the world  for burying that silky hair underground  where no one can use it?  Well, I mean, we did the work.
You have to pay us.
I'm sorry.
I could pay you in wigs.
Rhonda, is the hair made from dead people?  People?  No.
- Oh! Rhonda! - Oh, no, no.
That's from a skunk.
I was supposed to marry Shane Battier.
I'm not supposed to be scalping skunks.
I don't think you're ever supposed to scalp a skunk.
Yeah, and it's not an either/or  between scalping a skunk and marrying Shane Battier.
- Who's next? - Cash for Copper.
Both: Cash for your copper.
Do you have copper just laying around?  We will give you cash for your copper.
Do you know a place where copper is just laying around?  We will give you cash for your copper.
If you should happen to find copper  in someone else's walls or in a city fountain,  can we give you cash for that?  Well, legally, we can't say yeah.
But what we can do is wink.
[cash register dings.]
Sorry, guys.
We just can't pay you.
[sighs.]
Are you sure?  Yeah, man, this might actually be  one of our worst years ever  on the books.
Yeah, we ain't seeing no profits  on the books.
Yeah, we might even be showing  some losses on the books.
We are in debt  up to our asses  on the books.
So you can see how it would be  incongruous if we paid you  on the books.
What we can do is meaningfully look in the direction  of that big fat envelope over there  and just walk away.
Aw, tough break, man.
I feel bad for them.
I don't.
You got to get paid for the work you do.
- That's true.
- If it don't make money,  it don't make sense.
Sam, we have to go to that improv place  so you can shout out suggestions.
They're just gonna boo me again.
- Who's next? - Pete the Plumber.
But he said next time he sees us, he's gonna kill us.
Well, we have to try.
If you got a plumbing problem, call me, Pete the Plumber.
I'll take care of everything,  like leaky faucets,  rusty pipes,  water heaters,  and toilets.
We need our money.
Bro, you showed a shit.
- Honest mistake? - You showed a shit, bro.
Listen, contracts were signed.
Services were delivered.
I mean, business is business.
It's not personal.
[chuckles.]
[laughs mockingly.]
What's that?  That's how you laugh, bro.
[laughs mockingly.]
That is how you laugh, Sam.
[chuckles.]
[chuckles mockingly.]
That's how you laugh, Tim.
[laughs.]
- [laughs mockingly.]
- [laughs.]
Ha-ha-ha! Huh-huh-huh!  [all laughing.]
Hey!  Get out of here with these stupid-ass T-shirts.
Oh, no, these aren't stupid, and they're for sale.
- They don't make sense.
- Actually, they do.
It's a play on the word "Detroit.
"  - Yeah.
- It's  Both: "De-two-roit.
"  Oh.
[chuckles.]
Get the [bleep.]
out of here.
Who even cares?  Seems like everywhere you go,  you see shirts with Detroit slogans.
Okay.
Who's next?  Our last hope,  Roz Chunks, the mom attorney.
Hey, Linda, is Roz at the office or in court today?  Oh, she is? Really?  [laughs.]
Yeah, no, you too.
Hey, bye, Linda.
Man, you and Linda, I swear.
- Shut up.
- [chuckles.]
Linda said that Roz is out at her place in Royal Oak  'cause she had a double colonoscopy yesterday.
Man, Linda just tells you everything, man.
Can you forget about Linda and just head to Royal Oak?  If Roz pays up, we should have enough.
You know, it's getting late.
We should book it.
With pleasure, my friend.
Oh, no.
- [horns honking.]
- Dream Cruise.
[groans.]
[doo-wop music.]
[engines rumbling.]
I mean, can't we just cut through Vinsetta?  No.
All the roads are blocked off.
Plus, it would take too long to go back and go around.
We got to just go through.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!  What can I do you for, pal?  What are you doing with this piece of junk here?  This is the Dream Cruise.
Back it up.
Get this shit out of here.
- You back it up.
- You back it up.
- You back it up.
- Your shirts are stupid.
Oh, wearing that?  Okay, pal, let's put some tits on this puppy.
Putting lipstick on a turd   Putting makeup on a shit   Put a dress on a dookie   Then I'm kissing it   Lipstick on a turd   Lipstick on a turd   Lipstick on a turd   Lipstick on a turd   Haven't you heard   I'm putting lipstick on a turd   [bluesy rock music.]
[engine sputtering.]
[dramatic music.]
All right, yeah!  Yeah! Whoo!  Dream Cruise, baby!  She cleans up okay!    Lipstick on a turd   Lipstick on a turd   Lipstick on a turd   Lipstick on a turd   Haven't you heard   Oh, there's Sheila and Fletcher  and his Diamond Dogs.
She loves them bad boys, man.
Nothing but trouble.
Just go out with a nice man.
Why do they all have to be rebels?    Lipstick on a turd   Well, all right, let's get this money  from Roz Chunks, the mom lawyer.
Have you been injured or wronged?  Convicted of DUI?  Accused of murder  or had murder attempted onto you?  Call me, Roz Chunks,  and remember, I'm not just a lawyer.
I'm a mama.
Can we take a break, son?  Up yours, Roz Chunks!  Well, you raise 'em from a pup,  they grow up to be a dog.
You know, what can you do?  - Any form of discipline.
- Talk to him.
- Hit him.
- I mean anything.
I really would love to help you.
You know that.
I just I don't have the money.
See, my kid just learned how to masturbate,  so you know what that means.
- No, I definitely don't.
- I absolutely do not.
Well, long story short,  he got sent home from camp for being "disruptive,"  as the nuns put it.
Well, you really don't have to get into it.
- Sorry, nun camp? - You know, I don't want  to discourage him or, like, shame him,  make him think he's doing, like, a bad thing, you know.
It's just the way he does it.
It's wrong.
You know, it's just, like, the dead-eye stare  and his little shuffling feet  and yelling when he busts.
He's already gone through all of his soccer socks,  moved on to shin pads.
- Shin pads.
- Well, anyway,  little tugger got ahold of my credit card  and signed up for some pretty expensive pay-to-play sites,  and I didn't you know, I didn't say anything at first  'cause it was all that, like  It was granny fanny kind of stuff,  and his gram-gram had just passed  - Oh, sorry for your loss.
- Oh, it wasn't my mother.
So I just I didn't want to, you know,  interrupt his grieving process  or whatever, so I ignored it.
Well, you know, since you don't have the money,  we're just gonna take  It must have worked, too, 'cause, you know,  then I see he's going on all these,  like, obscure sites, you know  Well, gonna be hell getting back.
Yeah, well, if it was the cartoon stuff,  I'd understand, right?  'Cause that's for kids, you know.
You got, like, a jacked Ned Flanders  just reaming Marge Simpson  or like Bart doing Lisa  with a huge drippin hog.
It's funny 'cause, like,  you know it's incest, but it's okay  'cause they're cartoons, right?  Groundskeeper Willie's always in there somewhere.
He's got he's got a pretty nice piece too.
Who else? Who else?  - Milhouse.
- Sure, yeah, Milhouse.
Glasses, ripped shirt, huge dripping hog,  blue pubes everywhere.
- Yup.
- [car door opens.]
Well, it's fine you don't have the money.
Yeah, we understand.
Hey, bud,  I'll give you ten bucks  for one of these T-shirts.
Oh, absolutely.
- I'm glad you like 'em.
- You see?  Finally, someone appreciates our humorous fashion.
- Hmm.
- It ain't for fashion, buddy.
I'm gonna bust a nut in this.
- Ugh, little rascal.
- What can you do?  Any form of discipline, honestly.
Hit him.
[funky music.]
So now what?  How are we gonna turn this $10 into what we need?    Ouch!  You scratched my neck, man! That's assault!  Sir, I've got you on camera, all right?  You assaulted my friend.
What's your name, bro?  - Is my neck bleeding? - Ah, it's not even red.
Shoot.
I can't believe we turned $10 into $7,400.
I know.
I can't believe you lost it on one spin.
I was on a roll.
You bet on green.
Well, you tried to flip the table over.
- It was so frickin' heavy.
- Yeah, I know.
That's why I tried to karate chop it in half.
Does your hand hurt?  [smooth R&B music.]
Well, that's it.
We failed.
Lea's gonna quit,  and the only T-shirt we sold is now a little bully's nut rag.
Go ahead, Sam.
Try and cheer me up.
No can do, my number one pal.
We chunked it, and we chunked it hard.
Well, let's go tell her.
- Hey.
- Oh!  I'm sorry to bother you,  but I know how important Lea is to you guys,  so I came in to crunch some numbers,  and it turns out that with my salary off the books,  you cleared enough money to pay the insurance premium.
- Awesome! - Oh, that's great.
Thanks!  Yeah, I thought that would make you happy.
So?  So?  Well, do I have my job back?  What?  Well, I solved the problem.
I'm an asset to the company.
I proved my worth.
You also proved that we can't afford to hire you back.
[melancholy music.]
Oh, Wallace, you idiot.
- I feel bad for him.
- Yeah, I know.
He really saved the day.
- He did.
- Lea, guess what.
- What? - We got your insurance.
You can stay.
We saved the day.
That's actually really cool of you guys.
- Thanks.
- Come on in here, girl.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Get in here, little stinker.
Don't be a little stinker.
Mm, you little stinker.
[chuckles.]
Lea, were you really gonna quit?  - Yeah.
- Oh, well,  you don't have to now, so come on.
Come on.
Get a little huggy.
- Come on.
- Little huggy in there.
- We love you.
- We love you so much.
Got to know we love you.
We definitely love you.
I'm sure go'' miss this place.
- Get out of here, man! - Get out of here, man.
What are you still doing here?  - I'm done with it! - Don't make me say it again.
It's gonna get ugly.
Go!  [indistinct speech over P.
A.
system.]
You know, I'm really glad we got insurance.
I haven't been to the doctor in ten years.
Not since Spuds MacKenzie bit me at Autorama.
Well, you tried to take off his sunglasses.
He frickin' freaked.
I'm so scared.
What's gonna happen when we go in there?  I have no idea.
I hope the doctor's hot like Terry Bradshaw.
[chuckles softly.]
Sam Duvet.
- See ya, bud.
- Yeah.
So how much do you drink?  I'd say I'm good for about 10 or 12.
Okay.
10 or 12 a week?  - That's not bad.
- A week? Well  You drink 10 or 12 beers a day?  You're counting beers too?  Yes, of course.
Pff  [mouthing words.]
You're still counting.
Yeah, I can just do 'em like this.
- By fives? - Yeah.
How many hot dogs do you eat in a day, Tim?  I'd rather not answer that.
Thank you, though.
Did you eat hot dogs today?  Not exactly.
Why are you bringing this up?  Well, you have mustard on your shirt,  and frankly, your burps reek of hot dogs.
I had a hot dog bowl earlier today.
Yes, I did.
And what is a hot dog bowl?  It's like a burrito bowl,  but it's chopped-up hot dogs in a big old bread bowl.
So like a much larger, less healthy hot dog?  Can I go? I'm starving.
So how is the ankle?  Oh, it's fine.
Can you tell me what these are?  Looks like you've got a Vicodin,  Lipitor, two Percocet,  half a Pepto Bismol, and a green M&M.
Why would you do that?  Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God.
I think I'm pregnant.
I'm late.
Ma'am, I don't think you can have a baby.
You're telling me!  My parents would kill me.
Now, let's do this.
Where are the stirrups?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
I can't have a baby!  I'm a dancer!  Cheryl!  [indistinct speech over P.
A.
system.]

--- S01E09 ---
1 All right, Chuck, we're gonna  walk you through the commercial here.
Now, as you know,  the camera is gonna be the point of view  of the little Husky Boy shopper,  so we open on:  he enters the store.
The camera pans up.
He looks to Mom.
It comes back down.
We see a bunch of fat little boys in suits.
- Husky boys.
- I'm sorry?  We don't call 'em fat.
We call 'em husky.
Oh.
Okay, sure.
Then we see some tennis outfits  being worn by a couple real chunkers.
- Husky boys.
- I'm sorry?  Again, we call 'em husky boys.
Oh, you're not just objecting to "fat.
"  You don't like any of the terms.
Oh, we just prefer to use "husky.
"  Got it.
Okay.
To bring it all home,  we feature your soon-to-be-famous  elastic band jeans  being worn by a real blue-ribbon butterball.
I apologize.
That is what's written down there.
I am sorry about that.
Husky boy.
Being worn by a husky boy.
- It's not as good.
- No, it definitely isn't.
Then in our dramatic conclusion,  we see two chubby little hands  - Husky.
- Even the hands?  - Everything.
- All right.
- Uh, we see two husky hands - Ugh!  - Not covered in chocolate.
- That kills me.
They reach down, pick up a pair of Husky Boy jeans.
Stretch this out a little bit.
Yeah, stretch it out a little bit.
He looks up.
Mom smiles.
He's gonna look great.
End of commercial.
- Nice.
Yeah.
- Thank you.
Maybe a tagline at the end, you know, to bring it all home?  Uh, you know what? We haven't landed on one yet,  but we'll write up 100 and bring you the best one.
Actually, we do have a couple great ones.
Uh, no we don't.
The meeting's over.
Let's see, uh, "Husky Boys:  keep your wallet as fat as your kid.
"  - That seems a little offensive.
- Sure does, Sam.
Sorry, we don't have one yet.
I apologize.
"Don't spend a chunk on your chunk.
"  No.
We don't have it yet.
I'm sure you'll come up with something.
- Oh, definitely.
- You know, I don't know  if I ever told you this,  but I actually worked with your father  when I was at Hudson's Department Store.
I was actually at the meeting when,  you know, he went nuts.
I prefer "bonkers.
"  Oh.
Of course.
Bonkers.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, he came in  to pitch an ad for our back to school sale,  and he had us close our eyes, and when we opened them,  he had pulled out this briefcase.
Swear to God,  it was filled to the brim with shit.
And he walked around the table  and put a little handful in front of each of us.
As he made his way up the table,  I realized he only had the front half of his suit.
He had cut out the rest.
Totally naked in the back.
I found that to be odd.
So there we were, sitting there,  little servings of shit in front of us,  staring at this half-naked man,  and you know what?  We were still waiting for him to bring it all home.
That's how good he was, man.
[laughs.]
Big Hank Cramblin.
They don't make 'em like that anymore.
Thank you for telling me that story, sir.
"Husky Boy Jeans.
They're not food, but you'll still love them.
"  - Closer.
- We don't have it!  [upbeat music.]
I mean, I guess I just don't want to feel  like I'm being censored in front of a client.
No, no, no, and I don't want you to feel that way.
I was just feeling a little off 'cause I kept forgetting  to call the fat kids "husky.
"  [laughing.]
That was so funny.
I mean, you always call them fat.
That's what they are.
[laughter.]
Where is Sheila?  [gasps.]
Tim, finally, a mystery.
Yes.
[Sheila laughing.]
- Mystery solved.
- Yeah.
Get me a box of those pens I like.
Set me up with a massage at 2:00.
And see if you can get ahold of Emilio.
Have him come over  and measure me for some new suits.
You got it, Big Hank.
Hey, Dad.
Tim, Sam.
They let you out?  Of the nuthouse?  Yeah, got released this morning.
[dramatic music.]
I'm back.
You ain't shit.
Never said I was.
Well, you've implied it.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   [laughter and chatter.]
What is going on in there?  Right?  I've never made anybody  laugh like that my entire life.
- Well, me.
- Yeah, you.
So I said, "Fine, Doc,  "but if you think you're getting  those pajamas back, you're crazy.
"  [laughter.]
It is great to have you back, Hank.
Thank you.
We missed Cramblin Advertising.
We didn't go anywhere, and it's Cramblin-Duvet now.
That's me, so  Tim, you remember Leslie  from Better Made Potato Chips?  Yes, Sam and I pitched you an idea about a boat captain  piloting a battleship down a river made of potato chips.
You said you'd think about it and get back to us.
That was three years ago.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.
The answer is no.
- Sure.
- We figured.
It's just good to know sometimes.
Well, it's great to have you back, Big Hank.
Thank you, Leslie.
Thank you so much.
Guys, you ready to wine and dine Dan from Downriver Ale?  Top of the Pontch.
Oh, Dad, Sam and I should stay here.
Tim, Top of the Pontch.
We have to come up with taglines for Husky Boys.
Small potatoes.
Let's go reel us in a big fish from Downriver.
[funky music.]
[laughter.]
So I drop the knife.
My hands are covered in blood.
And here comes Hank  riding a motorcycle he stole from God knows where.
I hop on, shut my eyes,  and the next thing I know, we're back in San Diego!  [laughter.]
I don't get it.
Did Dan from Downriver Ale kill a guy in Mexico?  I mean, I think so?  Four Downriver Ales.
Yeah, what are you guys having?  [laughter.]
I-I thought one of those was for me.
Yeah, I guess we'll have four beers each too.
Give us four hanger steaks, rare,  all the sides the table can hold,  and, well, another round.
I wanted the filet.
To our wives and girlfriends.
May they never meet!  [laughter.]
Oh! Hey, Dan, let's talk turkey.
You know, I have to say something.
I didn't particularly like that joke.
I love my wife.
- Well, sure, kid.
I was just - I respect her.
And before I tell a joke, I like to ask myself,  "If she was sitting right next to me, would I tell this joke?"  That comment crossed the line.
I don't think it was very funny.
[clears throat.]
It's great to see you again, Hank, but  everybody at Downriver Ale is happy where we are.
Our ads are hilarious.
People love 'em.
Yeah, they are funny.
Tim, Sam, what's your favorite beer?  - Downriver Ale.
- Why is that?  Because you drank it.
I used to steal his beers from the fridge  in the garage while he was at work.
I always wondered how my six-packs became four-packs.
[laughter.]
You know, Dan, your commercials are funny.
But there's nothing funny about the feeling you get  when you steal a beer out of your dad's fridge.
Do you want to be the funny beer?  You go ahead.
With us, Downriver Ale, it's no joke.
To our mouths and buttholes.
May they never meet.
- Yes.
- Hear, hear.
[laughter.]
Now, that's a good joke.
[smooth R&B music.]
Sheila, pot of coffee, two aspirin.
Waiting on your desk, Big Hank.
Best in the business, baby!  I can't believe how much they drank.
What about me?  I had two pieces of chocolate cake.
Yeah, what was that?  Nobody else got dessert.
We had to sit there and watch you for 20 minutes.
Oh, so that's the top story now?  That I had two pieces of cake for lunch?  It's page one, baby.
Shut up.
"Husky Boys:  "Technically girls  can shop here too.
"  That's great.
"Husky Boys:  We're gonna hide the way you look.
"  "Husky Boys: the official wardrobe of the Klumps.
"  "Husky Boys: 'Cause you can't wear  a little sailor suit forever.
"  "Husky Boys: the belts are just for show.
"  "Husky Boys:  Chode style.
"  "Husky Boys: Propeller hat not included.
"  And that's 100.
Well, which one's the best one?  - None of them.
- Well, we tried.
I'm gonna go run some of these by my dad.
[knocking.]
Hey, Dad.
Uh, you mind if we run  some of these Husky Boy taglines by you?  Oh, can't, son.
Got Liberty Airlines first thing tomorrow.
Lot of catching up to do.
Okay, cool.
Uh, do you need any help with those?  [chuckles softly.]
I think I got it.
Maybe I'll meet up with you guys later on tonight.
Sounds good.
[melancholy music.]
[rock music playing.]
313-555-0197   Frank Franklin.
That was one of the first commercials  we ever did together.
Yeah, we heard that melody in another commercial  and we were like, "Let's just use that.
"  I'm gonna miss being in charge.
Yeah, it was a good run, though, pal.
Oh, sure was.
Guards at the Wayne County Insane Asylum  went on strike this morning after their paychecks bounced.
When pressed for comment,  lawmakers said it was not a mistake, saying, quote  "We were just hoping they wouldn't notice.
"  And while the cats were away, the mice escaped,  as shown in this security footage.
- Damn it, he's still nuts! - Bonkers.
Tonight, dangerous lunatics  are scattered around the city of Detroit.
[laughing.]
But what else is new, right?  We'll be right back with sports, weather,  and my Chump of the Week.
Stick with us.
All right, let's go get 'em.
Well, Tim, we can't miss Mort Crim's Chump of the Week.
- Come on, Sam.
- Tim, Chump of the Week.
- Come on! - Ugh!  Stupid.
[elevator dings.]
There's a gigantic man in your office.
He gave me some great notes on a commercial,  and then he asked me to cut out the back half of his suit.
Yeah, we're on it.
That's my dad.
That's your dad?  Yeah.
You did not come from that.
Yes, I did.
It's my dad.
Good night, guys.
Good night.
[scoffs.]
And that sucker is Mort Crim's Chump of the Week.
Good night, Detroit.
Damn it, Tim.
- We missed the Chump of the Week.
- [line ringing.]
And you know Mort doesn't put stuff online.
I'm sorry.
[phone rings.]
Wayne County Insane Asylum.
Hi, this is Tim Cramblin from Cramblin-Duvet Advertising.
We have one of your lunatics.
- It's my dad, Hank Cramblin.
- Oh, okay.
I need to put you in contact with the orderlies  who are rounding up the patients.
They're putting me in touch with the orderlies  who are rounding up all the patients.
Oh, cool.
[beatboxing.]
We out here driving late at night   Looking for crazy people, what a fright   You look to the left   -  Look to the right  - [cell phone buzzes.]
- Hello?  - Hello, boys.
I have the son of one of the escaped patients.
Thanks, Helen.
Put him through.
This is Darron.
How may I help you?  Uh, yeah, hi.
Uh, we have my dad,  who escaped from your asylum.
Is anyone in danger?  No, he seems fine.
Okay, if you can, bring him in yourselves.
We got a lot of nutballs to scoop up.
No offense to your father.
Oh, none taken.
We'll bring him in, okay?  Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
There go one of 'em right there!  Get him.
[tires squealing, all groan.]
[holiday music playing on TV.]
Hey, Pop.
Good evening, Mr.
Cramblin.
I was going through some stuff,  found this video of an old Christmas party.
[applause.]
Whoa, what's Santa got old Wallace here?  What? It's an empty bottle of gin, Wallace.
Both: Oh, Wallace.
We found so many in your desk,  we figured you collected them.
[laughter.]
[chuckles.]
What'd you get me, Santa Hank?  Whoa, look at Sheila.
Yeah, she was even hotter back then.
Ho, ho, ho!  Well, if Big Hank was here,  I'm sure he'd tell you all thank you so much  for another amazing year,  and merry Christmas.
All: Merry Christmas.
Ho! Look, my little elves!  And they got a cake!  [applause.]
[Both chuckling.]
All: Oh!  Crap! Damn it, Sam.
Me? That was your fault, Tim.
[chuckles.]
Tim, Sam.
Listen up.
Stop.
[Both laughing.]
All right, guys.
Listen up.
Stop it.
Dude, stop it.
You actually hurt my back.
You're a tip-to-tail piece of crap.
Okay, you two.
Hug and make up.
- You're my best friend.
- You're my best friend.
- [laughter.]
- Merry Christmas, boys.
Ah.
We got to bring you back, Dad.
Mort Crim reported the escape  right before he announced his Chump of the Week.
Who was Chump of the Week?  We don't know.
Well  I guess this is it.
Dad, wait.
Is there anything you want to do before we take you back?  One last night in Detroit.
Sky's the limit.
Well, I would like to get the hell out of this office  and hang out with my son and his best friend.
- Sounds good.
- You got it.
How about we go to Lindell AC and get us a burger?  - Oh, sorry, Dad.
- That closed.
- Chin Tiki? - Demolished.
- Boblo Island.
- It's condos now.
- House I grew up in? - It's a hipster bar.
- Michigan Theater.
- It's a parking garage.
- Silverdome.
- Abandoned.
- Old Tiger Stadium.
- Dad, they closed  Tiger Stadium before you went nuts.
Plus, you called it Old Tiger Stadium.
Okay, I'd like to see the sunrise one last time.
Detroit still has a sun, right?  Yeah.
Well, I guess we've got some time to kill.
[JR JR's "Gone".]
[upbeat indie pop music.]
I can't be   Everything you want me to be   I can't be   Everything you want me to be   Finally   I can see the light through the leaves   But it's all gone     But it's all gone     But it's all gone     But it's all gone     [firecrackers popping and whistling.]
[laughs.]
[gunshots.]
[car alarm blaring.]
Well, there you go, Pop.
We give you one Detroit sunrise.
Yeah, it's one of my favorite places.
I used to take you guys fishing here.
Yeah, Mr.
Cramblin.
You sure did.
I caught a carp the size of my head.
[laughs.]
I remember that.
Took turns reeling that sucker in.
[howls.]
We for sure got to get back.
Yeah.
Boys, thanks for a great night.
It's our pleasure, Mr.
Cramblin.
Sam, you can call me Hank.
It was great to see you, Dad.
I'll come visit this weekend.
I'd like that.
Yeah, we actually have to get  to that Husky Boys shoot.
I know it's just small potatoes, but  Ah, small potatoes, big potatoes.
Hey, it's food on the table.
Proud of you.
Thanks, Dad.
You know, there's something I've been wanting to tell you.
The meeting at Hudson's?  - Yeah.
- The shit in the briefcase?  Yeah.
Wasn't my shit.
I think that actually makes it worse, Dad.
- It does? - Yeah.
Hmm.
Well, Sam.
Hank.
- Son.
- Dad.
- Love you.
- Love you too.
- Did he say it wasn't his shit? - Yeah.
I mean, that makes it worse, doesn't it?  Yeah, no, that's what I told him.
That's exactly what I told him.
Husky Jeans, skinny prices.
Yup, I mean, that's it.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll send you a bill.
See you in the funny pages.
You okay?  Yeah.
It was actually a great day.
It's like we were spending time with the best version of my dad.
There was no anger, fits of rage, paranoia.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Fecal hoarding.
Hank! Hey, Hank! Come on! Come on, Hank!  Maybe he is actually getting better.
I'm gonna talk to doctors this week,  see if he can get out.
He could maybe even come and help us out  a few times a week in the office.
- That'd be great.
- It'd be awesome.
Hey, can I buy you breakfast?  No, you can't, 'cause I'm buying you breakfast.
Don't do that, Tim.
You know, when you don't let me pay for stuff,  it's like your way of controlling me.
Controlling you? I'm being nice.
- Yeah, right.
- [Hank laughing.]
How's buying you breakfast not nice?  - Don't do this, man! - Tim, it's systemic racism.
We're fat, man! Come on, slow down.

--- S01E10 ---
1 - Humpf.
- Another round?  No, I think I'm good.
It's open bar  - Let's get another round.
- Yeah, let's get one.
Come on.
- Fun night.
- Yeah.
I don't even care if we win.
Oh, we're gonna win.
Yeah, of course, totally,  but I'm saying even if we don't win  Yeah, we're gonna.
Yeah, no, I know.
I mean, same page.
I'm just saying that, you know, I'm so proud  of the work that we've done that I don't need  the validation of my peers to make me feel good about it.
- Yeah.
But we're gonna win.
- Yes.
Hey, how ya doin'? I'll have four Boston Coolers.
But put some booze in 'em.
Can I have four White Russians?  Maybe put some booze in that?  You know what? Four more Boston Coolers.
No booze.
I'll tell you what.
You know what?  Put some booze in them.
A little booze in those.
- Wow, you guys must be thirsty.
- Carter?  Carter Grant, VP of marketing, Chrysler?  - Well, not anymore.
- Oh, you changed your name?  No, same name.
- Um, I actually got fired.
- What happened?  Well, I've hit a string of bad luck as of late.
It all started with that accident I was in.
You guys remember that?  Doesn't ring a bell.
Oh.
Well, I got run over by some maniac.
It damaged your leg permanently?  We are so sorry  that happened to you.
Well, no, no.
This is actually, uh, from a separate incident.
Actually, the doctor that I had after the hit-and-run  got me back in tip-top shape.
Yeah, he was great.
In fact, he was so great that my wife left me for him.
- Carter! - No, I'm being serious.
- Oh, crap.
- Yeah, it's all right.
No, it's okay.
It was my fault, though.
You know, uh, all the pain meds  that I was on in the hospital got me drinking again,  and that was something I promised her I'd never do.
You know, that led to my accident.
- Drunk driving.
- Oh, no, no, no.
This was actually from mixed martial arts fighting.
Yeah, guy ripped off my patella.
I just sort of threw myself into it after Susan left me.
I was horrible at it, you know.
Just kept getting my ass kicked by black guys.
Why say black guys?  'Cause I could beat all the white guys.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah.
No, I thought this injury was my rock bottom,  but, uh, well, then this happened.
- Luke Skywalker hand! - Whoa!  - Yeah.
- How did that happen?  Yeah, well, you're gonna think this is made up,  but my dad cut off my hand.
- Oh! - Yeah.
Hey, silver lining, it did sober me up.
Yeah.
And I got rehired back at Chrysler.
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.
By my old protÃ©gÃ©, who's now the VP of marketing.
Half the salary, got a cubicle instead of an office,  so yep, it's been a long,  rough road recently for old Carter Grant.
I'll tell you what.
Winning a D Award tonight,  that'll make the pain go away.
We're actually up for the last ad  we made under my watch.
Oh, it was the Chrysler Pacifica spot  that you guys missed out on.
Wait, that campaign was for a specific car?  I thought it was just for Chrysler in general.
No, car companies don't really make generic commercials  for the entire brand.
If you want a specific car, get a Chrysler Pacifica.
It's a little late.
And not very good.
Understand.
Looks like your drinks are here.
Oh, yeah.
Well good luck, Carter.
Yeah, good luck.
Thanks, guys.
Really appreciate it.
You remind me of, uh,  better times.
I should go sit down,  as I'm in a great deal of pain.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Could we  Like, a tray or something?  - Something to carry this? - Just a tray  What you've done here is ridiculous.
Ladies and gentlemen,  please welcome to the stage our host for the evening,  Detroit's favorite son,  the cohost of "Tool Time,"  Al Borland!  Thank you very much.
Uh, you know, I asked them not to introduce me like that.
Al Borland is a fictional character  from a show called "Home Improvement.
"  I am not Al Borland.
I'm Richard Karn, and I'd like to welcome you  to Detroit Advertising's night of the year:  the D Awards!  I'll tell you, the producers asked me  not to sing tonight.
Yeah, right.
Maestro!  Well, tonight is your night   And the light is just right   If you try you just might   Win a D tonight   And the D for graphic design  Let your dreams take flight   Pomerantz and Klein!  High in the sky like a kite   Crazy Morgan.
With this D   You're the best there can be   Oh, say, can you see   At the D Awards tonight   Okay, folks, this is it.
The D Award for Consumer TV: Thirty Second Single.
First up, Downriver Ale from Doner.
Kid Rock: Detroit.
A city on its knees.
But we're ready to get back up and stand tall.
This is our town, and this is our beer:  Downriver Ale.
Little Caesars, also from Doner.
Kid Rock: Detroit.
It's not the size of the dog in the fight.
It's the size of the fight in the dog.
Is that Kid Rock again?  Kid Rock: Little Caesars.
This is our pizza pizza.
Chrysler Pacifica from Pomerantz and Klein.
Kid Rock: Detroit knows a little something  about hard work.
Those other towns?  They're hardly working.
Chrysler Pacifica.
This is our car.
And finally,  Quick Rick Mahorn in Dearborn.
Cramblin-Duvet Advertising?  Rick Mahorn from the Pistons has a car dealership?  I did not know that.
Let's take a look.
Who's the superhero saving Detroit from high prices?  Quick Rick Mahorn in Dearborn!  Help! I need to buy a car fast!  Who can help me?  I can help you.
It's me, Quick Rick Mahorn of Dearborn.
My parents were killed in an alley,  so I became a superhero who can run fast.
I can put you into an affordable used car like that.
Thanks, Rick Mahorn.
That was fast.
My work here is done.
I think I'll run to France and get me a croissant.
Ooh, la, la.
You want a fast deal,  come to Quick Rick Mahorn in Dearborn.
On Greenfield and Warren next to the big brown house   And the winner is  Doner, Downriver Ale!  Bullshit!  We'll get 'em next time, bud.
Even if we don't, it's still fun.
We'll get 'em next time.
- All right.
- Uh, guys.
- Hey, Carter.
- Tough break, man.
It's all right.
You know, you win some, you lose  everything.
Who knew everyone was gonna use Kid Rock, right?  Yeah, there was a lot of Kid Rock.
There was.
There really was.
Anyway, um, this is Judy Thompson.
She's director of marketing for Quicken Loans.
They're actually, uh, on the hunt for a new agency.
Yeah, someone small and local, and I  Well, you know, I recommended you guys.
Carter raves about you two.
I'd love to meet with you next week.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, we'll give you a call.
Sounds good.
Take care.
- Thank you, Carter.
- Yeah.
That was very nice of you.
Ah, don't worry about it.
I figure I owe you guys one.
All right.
Ow.
Ow.
We set in motion a chain of events  that ruined a man's life.
I can't believe this time yesterday,  all I cared about was winning a stupid D Award.
Well, we never stood a chance.
Yeah, I know that now.
Morning, Sheila.
These are for you.
Oh, thank you, Rick.
They're lovely.
You think the guys are in right now?  I want to talk to them about another ad.
- Go right in.
- Thank you.
I mean, how are we gonna compete with agencies  like Doner and Pomerantz and Klein?  We can't.
With their budgets, they can get the best actors.
I mean, they have Kid Rock.
Meanwhile we're stuck with Rick Mahorn.
- Yeah.
- I mean, bless his heart,  but Rick Mahorn can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.
Well, let's not dwell on it.
Let's just come up with a pitch for Quicken Loans.
Yeah, okay.
Um  - Quicken Loans.
- Quicken Loans.
Quicken Loans, Bicken Bones.
- Maybe.
- Yeah?  Why is our first move always to rhyme?  Well, don't question the process.
Besides, Bicken Bones ain't nothing.
Oh, absolutely not.
Rick Mahorn can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.
Ooh, yeah.
Very good.
Very good.
Excellent.
Lose all of your inhibitions.
Yes.
Oh, can we help you?  Yes, you can.
I want to learn how to act.
You've come to the right place.
Join us.
You ready?  No.
Are you ready?  No.
So what do you have for us?  We open on a family in front of their dream home.
In order to afford the dream home,  the family needs a loan.
Why?  Because two maniacs ran over their dad and ruined his life.
So the dad's long gone.
Lost his hand.
Are you guys talking about Carter Grant?  - No.
- Can we finish, please?  - Okay.
- Um, so the mom needs a loan.
Who does she turn to?  The big stuffy banks? Psh, no, thanks.
Quicken Loans?  Hmm.
Maybe.
But who are they?  What are they? I don't know.
Why?  Because you need a mascot.
Buying a home should be fun.
It shouldn't be scary.
It shouldn't make you think of your own mortality  and that we're all gonna die  and one day, a man's gonna shove cotton up your butthole.
I apologize; I'm going through some personal stuff right now,  and I think some of it's seeping out.
Yeah, me too; I'm going through  the same stuff as him, actually.
Yeah, it's the same personal stuff  - that we're going through.
- Exact same event.
Uh  buying a home should be fun.
It shouldn't be scary.
It  You know what?  I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
I'm well aware that we have you  in the palm of our hands right now,  and I could pull down this card right now,  show you this mascot.
Oh.
Oh!  And it would blow each and every one of you  out of the water.
But I'm afraid that would all be fruit  from a poisonous tree.
So we respectfully decline your business.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for your time and your respect.
- Thank you.
- No worries.
To be honest, we just set this meeting up to be polite.
You know, I wish people would quit doing that!  It's mean!  This is, like, our real job, you know what I mean?  It's not, like, a game.
Ugh!  What a frickin' joke.
I've got to see this mascot.
What did he tell you, Bobby?  Huck's been shot.
He's dead.
He's in heaven.
Uh, and scene.
You loved Huck.
- Thanks, Coach.
- Mm-hmm.
And again.
What did he tell you, Bobby?  He said Huck's been shot.
He's dead.
He's going to heaven now.
And scene.
Yes!  Yes!  I think we found our Mama.
I can't live like this anymore.
We have to tell Carter what we did.
No way, man.
We'll go to jail, Sam.
We almost killed him.
So, uh, do you have any ideas for a commercial?  We have to be honest, man.
We don't.
What's the name of your store again?  It's just called Electronics Store.
Yeah, there's nothing we can do with that.
And so the proof turned out not to be in the pudding  but, rather, in the murderer's blood and semen.
We'll be back after these words.
This weekend, be sure to catch "All the Fixin's,"  an original play starring Pistons legend Rick Mahorn.
Rick Mahorn's in a play?  It's got all the laughs, all the tears,  all the fixin's.
That's what the TV said.
Tim, just Obviously.
Prisoner 44,  why should we let you out of jail today?  Because it's my mama's birthday.
Hey, hey, what's up? What's up?  Hey, where's mama?  Bobby, Mama's sick.
I've done everything I can for this family,  worked my fingers to the bone.
Don't talk to me like that.
- I'm a grown-ass man.
- Stop it.
Enough!  I'm going to get Mama.
- Mama! - Mama!  I've been in this bed  listening to y'all in here fussing and cussing.
I ain't raised y'all like that.
Go for it, Rick.
Someone set that stove on  and bring me all the fixin's.
Whoo!  You think we gon' miss a meal in this house?  Bullshit!  I'll never get a chance to tell Mama the truth  of what I did that day,  and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
We have to tell Carter.
Yeah, we'll tell him first thing tomorrow.
Detroit basketball!  Rick! Rick! Rick!  Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick!  Don't look over there.
Those are cars that haven't been released yet.
I'm screwing around.
Well, this is me.
I know.
I know.
It's small.
- Oh, no.
- It is.
- Tim.
- It is.
So I heard you guys really tanked the Quicken Loans meeting, huh?  - Just chunked it.
- Yeah?  Yeah, but that's actually not why we're here.
Carter, we have something  very important to tell you.
Yeah? Well, you're catching me on a good day.
You're not gonna believe this, but, uh,  well, I was walking home last night.
Who do I bump into? Shandy Hogan.
- Wow! - Oh, that's great!  - What are the odds? - Oh, you know her.
- No.
- We were just being supportive.
Yeah, go on, Shandy Hogan or whatever.
Yeah, Shandy Hogan, yeah, my high school sweetheart.
First girl I ever loved,  and guess what she does for a living.
- Pilot.
- No.
- Sleazy record producer.
- No.
- Drummer.
- No.
Professional muscle lady.
No, guys, it's something good.
- Knight.
- City councilwoman?  No, she's a physical therapist.
- Yeah, that's okay.
- Oh, sweet.
No, it is good, because we started talking about my leg.
Yeah, next thing you know, we're having dinner together.
Next thing you know, we've been talking so long  that the restaurant closes around us and they had to kick us out.
Oh, those assholes!  Oh, no, it was fine.
It was great, actually.
I'm gonna see her again tonight.
Oh, Carter, that's great.
It's funny, you know?  Had I met her a year ago,  I would have been married to some woman that, let's face it,  I obviously wasn't supposed to be with.
Ain't life something?  So I guess you're saying  getting hit by that car  was the best thing that ever happened to you.
Well, I wouldn't say that.
Would you, please?  Please what?  Say getting hit by that car  was the best thing that ever happened to you?  - Why? - No reason.
Might be fun to say out loud.
See how it feels.
You guys ran over me.
Yeah.
Yeah, we ran over you.
Guilty!  You guys ran over me.
You did.
You put a bag of chips on my head,  and you dumped me in the woods, and you left me for dead.
"You threw me in the woods and left me for dead.
"  Hey, did you? Yes or no?  Yes! We ran you over.
Carter, we are so sorry.
You dumb son of a bitches ruined my life.
Look, it was just an accident.
Yeah, Carter, we'll do anything to make it up to you.
Make it up to me? How are you gonna make up  starting off a chain of events that led to this?  Well, I mean, there's got to be something.
No, there's nothing you could do  to make us even for what you've done to me.
Yes, there is.
Oh, you think I'm just gonna let you off  by sucking my [bleep.]
?  - That's not it.
- Tim, is that it?  - That's not it.
- Oh, okay, okay.
- That's not what I was thinking.
- Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
This sucks!  You ready, assholes?  - No! - Hey, uh, we changed our minds.
Yeah? Well, tough shit, 'cause here I come.
Aaaah!  Cover up your hog!  I can't.
My hands aren't big enough.
That's good.
Sons of bitches.
I'd piss on you right now,  but I'm a Chrysler man.
That's not how we do things.
Alright, that shit, folks!  I have been Richard Karn.
You have been wonderful.
Drive safe! We'll see ya next year.
And if you're watching at home, I don't know how,  we're not televised.
Get on, everybody!

--- S02E01 ---
1 And the commercial would begin with a cartoon version  of you who keeps popping up and talking about all the deals  you have at Mr.
Alvin's.
Oh, I love that.
Looks just like me.
Yeah, we figured that he'd keep on  popping up and he'd be like,  "Come on down to Mr.
Alvin's.
"  We've got FILA 29, or two for 50.
"  "Nike, 29 or two for 50.
"  Why does he sound like that?  I'm sorry?  Why does the cartoon sound like that?  Oh, he doesn't.
Yeah.
You do.
You sound like that.
That's right.
I like the cartoon.
Just don't make him sound all stupid and shit.
Have you heard your voice?  That is our eighth yes in a row!  My friend, we are officially on a hot streak.
- Officially! - Officially!  Gentlemen, are you ready to go to dinner?  What are you talking about?  Oh sh  - Oh, yes.
- No.
- That's right.
- Dinner.
Oh, your anniversary dinner!  Oh, well, two reasons to celebrate!  Shall we go?  Guys, you're dressed like shit.
Yeah, but you look like you're about to go on the Titanic.
Oh, boom, beast.
Let's go.
- Come on, let's go! - Come on now!  I guess you didn't like your food.
Then why'd I finish it, butt-munch?  Don't be an asshole.
To Sheila!  And her 50 years with the company!  That old gray mare is still what she used to be.
You must have seen it all.
Yeah, what was it like back when you started, Sheila?  It was the golden age of advertising.
And your father was the best.
I even had my moment.
Did you know I came up with the tagline  for Wick's pantyhose?  "Control top to make him lose control.
"  That's pretty racy.
I was talking about making the man ejaculate early.
Oh, cool.
Mm-hmm.
Of course there was no credit and I wasn't paid,  because I was just a secretary.
It was a different world back then.
Sam, you would've had a hell of a time.
- Oh, I know.
- Yeah, we all would've.
Well  We all would've had a bad time.
Not the same.
Well, happy 50th, Sheila.
And happy hot streak!  Eight in a row, baby!  Gentlemen, thank you.
You've made an old lady very, very drunk.
- We'll walk you out.
- No, no, no, no, no.
We got that big pitch tomorrow.
We have to get hammered so we can have a good night's rest.
Oh, that's right.
You know how to get out, Sheila.
Same way you came in, just backwards.
You good to get home?  You're gonna take an Uber, right?  Oh, yeah.
This beer's giving me heartburn.
I gotta switch over to Bob Seger's diet tequila.
Yeah, me too.
Excuse me, waiter?  Can we have two "Light Moves," please?  Tim Cramblin?  - Yes, I'm Tim Cramblin.
- Come on.
Yep, I'm Tim Cramblin, and I'm gonna take a dump  in the backseat of your car.
Don't you take a dump back there, Tim Cramblin!  - Oh, I'm gonna.
- Asshole!  Stop trying to lower my rating!  You gonna say Detroit City   When we get in there, let me do the talking.
- Why? -   Let me do some of the talking.
Well, yeah.
Aw, damn it!  Ryan Lepchek from Doner Advertising.
We're dead.
Oh my God.
Tim! Sam.
Suck it, Lepchek!  Suck it, Cramblin!  Wow, pitching the Science Center, huh?  It's certainly a step up for you fellas.
Step down for you.
Oh, okay.
Well, look, good luck in there, all right?  And good on you guys, swinging for the fences.
Bad on you, swinging an aluminum bat  to the back of your head.
Boom! You're a vegetable!  Thank God we're not at the zoo.
That place stinks like shit!  Detroit Zoo is a prison for animals!  Nine in a row!  The Science Center is another level!  Yeah, man! It's the Science Center!  We beat Ryan Lepchek from Doner!  With a yes in the room!  Uh-huh.
You want to ride it again? One more time?  - Yeah, let's ride it again.
- One more time.
One more time and then we'll come back up  and then do it another time after that.
It's gonna be okay, Sheila.
It took me a while to realize it was perfume and not cologne.
- I still like it.
- I think you're good to go.
Why didn't you call her a cab?  - What? - Sheila, what happened?  She got a DUI after your dinner last night.
Sheila, we asked you if you were gonna take an Uber,  and you said yes!  I don't know what Uber is!  Why did you say yes?  I didn't want to seem old!  Oh, Sheila, you're not old.
Uh, Tommy, Sheila is old, so  You know what, Sheila? We'll get you a lawyer.
We'll take care of everything.
Tommy, not the head!  - Not the head, Tommy.
- Tommy.
Okay, so I've narrowed it down to two lawyers.
Do you know your rights? Because I do.
If you are weak, I will fight for you.
And if you are strong, we will fight together.
I am Joumana Kayrouz.
- I like her.
- Yeah.
Check this guy out.
Have you been injured in an accident or a slip and fall?  Call me, Walt Worsch.
I'll try my best.
I got hit by a city bus,  and Walt got me some of the money I asked for.
I got arrested for drunk driving.
I got found guilty and served six months.
But I could tell Walt tried as hard as he could.
He even cussed when we lost.
Call 313-Waltries.
I'm Walt Worsch, and I try my best.
He included a testimonial from a guy who lost?  Yeah.
I mean, I think we gotta go with Joumana.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Look at this.
Walt Worsch has an "April in the D" video?  Hey, what's up, Detroit?  It's April in the D, that magical month  when the Pistons, Red Wings, and the Tigers  are all playing at the same time.
This is my video submission for the Fox Sports Detroit  theme song contest.
Please vote for me.
Check it out.
Pistons and Tigers and Red Wings oh my   It's April in the D   Three Detroit sports teams playing at one time   All Detroit ladies looking oh so fine   He is so confident.
I meant that's how he should be in his ads, right?  Ooh, you know what? If we hire him to represent Sheila,  that would be a foot in the door for his business.
Uh-huh.
And if we got his business, that would be ten in a row.
Ten in a row.
It's April in the D   Well, I'll do my best, guys,  but I can't make any promises.
DUls are tough.
Will they take away my driver's license?  I do not know.
Look, to be honest,  I'm kind of a mack when it comes to dog bites.
When the officer pulled you over, did you get bit by a dog?  No.
Oh, crap.
'Cause I'm kind of a mack at dog bites.
- Gentlemen, shall we go? - Oh, hold on a minute.
He didn't say he was bad at DUls.
He just said he's a mack at dog bites.
- Kind of a mack.
- Kind of a mack.
Thank you for your time, Walter.
But we really need to meet with other lawyers  before we make a decision.
Now hold on, Sheila.
I mean, after all we are footing the bill here.
And I think Walter here might secretly be  the best lawyer in town.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Look, Walt, we we saw your "April in the D" video.
Oh, boy.
And it's breathtaking.
- I mean, you exude confidence.
- Yeah, you ooze it.
But in your commercials you come off a little bit stiff.
- And in person.
- But we can help with that.
- That's not why we're here.
- Shh.
You see, we run a small advertising firm  that's on a little bit of a hot streak.
Oh, really.
Would I know any of your clients?  Um the Michigan Science Center.
- Whoa.
The Science Center? - Holy shit!  What are those guys really like?  They're honestly so nice.
- I knew it.
- Mm-hmm.
So what do you say, Walt?  How about you let us put that rock star  from that "April in the D" video  in a commercial for your law firm?  Ms.
Portnadi, it looks like you got yourself a lawyer.
And if we're being 100, it would help me out a ton  if you get bit by a dog between now and the court date.
I'm not getting bit by a dog.
Okay, well, I wouldn't be doing my job  if I didn't suggest it.
And really, between you and I, it's really easy.
Just wait until they're eating, and then you grab their crotch.
So yeah.
- Ten in a row! - Walt Worsch, baby!  I'm Walt Worsch.
Have you been the victim of an accident or a bite?  I will fight for you.
And I always try my best.
313-Waltries, I try my best   That one's ours.
Excuse me, ma'am?  That commercial that just played, ours!  A local man is in dire need of a kidney tonight  and he's not telling anyone why.
- But first, a different story.
- Excuse me.
Do you know what this meeting is about?  I don't.
Oh, well, they were very vague on the phone, so  Well, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
Well, you should get some desk candies  that don't taste like medicine.
That is my medicine.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I ate all your medicine.
But you know what?  You shouldn't keep them on the desk like that,  so really it's both of our faults, really.
Yeah, it's both your fault.
It's both your fault!  Tim and Sam   Get up here.
Can we get you anything?  I'll take a Vernors.
Vernors.
I'll take a Vernors.
Do you have any chips?  You guys enjoying your Vernors?  Yeah, I just drank it too fast.
Yeah, you can't slug it too fast, or the bubbles  The bubbles.
So what's this all about?  You pissed because we got the Science Center?  Yeah.
Looks like we swung for the fences,  and your ass struck out.
We would like to buy Cramblin Duvet.
Is this a joke?  'Cause if it is a joke, I just want to say that I get it.
I get the joke, and I'm in on it also.
- And it's hilarious.
- No.
No, it's not a joke.
It's you guys are up-and-coming, okay?  We want to get in on it before everyone else realizes.
At Doner, we believe if you can't beat them,  you buy 'em.
What does what does this mean, exactly?  - You'd own Cramblin Duvet - Correct.
Mm-hmm.
So what would we do?  - We'd own Doner.
- We'd own Doner, right.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
Then yeah, I'll do it.
No, no, no.
It's not a trade.
Yeah, we know.
Yeah, I know.
I'm not stupid.
Basically, you would be getting paid  to do exactly what you've been doing,  you would just be doing it for Doner.
And and we would keep our name?  No, we would change the name.
- Team Viper.
- Excuse me?  Team Viper Snake Squad.
No, no.
It would be under the umbrella of  - Rowdy Boys.
- Rowdy Boys.
That's it.
- Rowdy Boys.
- Rowdy Boys.
- Yeah, we're the Rowdy Boys.
- Guys, look.
I think you'll find it's a generous buyout fee, okay?  Not to mention a bump in salary,  and you'd have all of Doner's resources at your disposal.
Seriously, you got something.
You made the worst lawyer in town look cool.
I don't know if he's the worst.
He's pretty bad.
My cousin got bit by a dog.
He couldn't do anything for him.
I thought he was a mack at dog bites.
That's what he said.
Guys, think about it.
Talk to your lawyer.
Sleep on it.
Well, I mean I'd rather sleep in a bed.
Not my best.
I'm a little overwhelmed, so who cares?  Oh, my God.
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
I ate her medicine.
And you should probably call a doctor for her.
Dani.
Ooh, you like her.
Next!  The People vs.
Sheila Portnadi.
Miss Portnadi was pulled over on Cass Avenue,  and her BAL was .
09.
Counselor.
Your Honor, I'm not here to try my worst.
All right, settle down, everybody.
Your Honor, look at my client.
Now close your eyes.
And imagine my client is not a woman, but a man.
And black.
And named Barack Obama.
Your Honor  And imagine that this arresting officer  is a dog, Your Honor.
Well, Your Honor, this dog bit my client.
Mr.
Worsch.
Your Honor, I'm only  Trying my best   16 hours community service.
And Ms.
Portnadi, in the future,  take a cab, or get a better lawyer.
Next.
16 hours of community service.
Ah, Sheila.
It won't be that bad.
It'll just be mowing the median on 75.
Whoa, Walt, she's pretty old.
Yeah, well, it's the best I could do.
Hey, Walt, while we have you,  can we get your legal advice on something?  Yeah, can you take a look at this contract?  It's an offer to buy the company,  Who offered to buy the company?  Ryan Lepchek from Doner.
- When did this happen? - Earlier today.
What do you think, Walt?  Doner has way more money and way smarter people than you.
So if this deal is good on their end,  it's probably bad on your end.
Oh, well, couldn't it be a good deal for both of us?  Are they smarter or are you smarter?  They're smarter, sir.
Then, no.
Hey, you know what?  Let's make this a working lunch.
How about Zoup, you two?  - Ooh.
- Yeah.
Sheila, good luck on 75.
Bring a hat, because it gets so hot out there.
The testimonials aren't working.
I can't find any cool kids here.
How about that guy?  Ugh.
I wouldn't jerk that guy off with Freddy Krueger's hand.
You just like come up with that?  Was that a joke?  - Yeah.
- Like a prepared joke?  - I just thought of it.
- Nobody just talks like that.
Nobody talks like that,  and plus it doesn't even make sense.
Like Freddy Krueger's hand, like, the palm is still good.
Yeah, the palm does all the jerking off.
Enough.
Well, you got to find somebody.
We told them we'd find testimonials  of people saying science is cool.
And it's not gonna be convincing coming from a dork.
Is it true you guys are selling the company?  Well, we'll let you know when we've made a decision.
Thank you very much, Lea.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
I just don't think there's any amount of money  that would allow me to take my dad's name off the wall.
It's been there for 50 years.
Well, we say we want to return  the company to its former glory.
- This would do that.
- Tommy's freaking out.
Why, what's up?  He keeps saying how none of this is in the Bible.
Get the edge, Portnadi!  What is wrong with your head? Get the edge!  They not gonna hit you! Get the edge!  I'm scared!  Oh, you're scared-scared, huh?  You should've thought about that  before you drove drunk-drunk.
Get that edge!  Get that mower on that edge!  Okay, now this is a work in progress.
Unless, of course, you like it.
Yeah, if you like it, it can be the finished product.
Yeah.
Come on down to the Michigan Science Center,  where science is cool.
This is fun, and I'm not even a nerd!  The word dork actually means whale penis.
So I'm definitely not a dork.
Do I look like a whale penis?  We're not dorks!  Would a dork do this?  - And even if you are a dork - I'm not a dork!  The Michigan Science Center is a bully-free zone.
Our security guards are former bullies themselves.
So they know what to look for.
Hey, watch out.
I want to do it.
Hey, get your hands off me!  Visit today!  It's not just for dorks and nerds anymore!  I thought you said you were gonna get real testimonials.
We couldn't get any good ones.
Yeah, besides, these actors seem very real.
No, they don't.
And not to mention you portrayed a Science Center  employee hitting a child.
A child bully.
It's a very important distinction.
Maybe we need to start looking for a different firm.
No, don't do that in front of us.
I told you this is a work in progress.
Look, Cramblin Duvet is as professional as any big firm.
How about we set up a meeting for next week?  Sheila, can you come in here?  We'll have a whole new concept for you.
Are you sure you're capable  of delivering a Science Center worthy ad?  No, they can't.
These two guys are pieces of shit.
What?  I can assure you that we are not.
She just got a DUI.
Guys, look, going with you guys  was kind of just an experiment on our part.
We just wanted to try something fun and kitschy,  but let's just face it, okay?  We're the Science Center, and, frankly, you're not.
That is devastating.
We're sorry we hired you a terrible lawyer.
We wanted his business, and we were assholes.
Please forgive us.
You were raging assholes.
And you want to know what really pisses me off?  I worked for this company for 50 years,  and you never once asked me what I thought  about you selling it.
When Big Hank left,  I was the only employee who stuck with you.
Now you just treat me like some old lady you have to deal with.
You're right.
We're two idiots who you call gentlemen every day.
You mean the world to us, Sheila.
And we'll do whatever it takes to show you  what you mean to the company.
Make me a partner.
A partner?  - No! - What are you talking about?  - Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Sorry, I apologize.
- We weren't expecting that.
We got a little overwhelmed.
Yeah, you really had that locked and loaded, didn't you?  I have given it a lot of thought.
- We'll make you a partner.
- Silent partner.
And I'll be involved with all the major decisions?  Starting with the big one.
We've thought long and hard about your offer.
Yes, and this is the amount  that we are willing  to sell our company for.
Yes.
Yeah.
That's good.
Here you go.
Okay, I'll give it to you.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Don't act like it hurt, you idiot.
That's good.
There we go.
What is this?  That is a middle finger, butt-munch.
Thank you for the offer and everything.
But it's a respectful no.
That felt good.
Nice work, partner.
You good to drive?  Oh, yeah.
Sheila! Could you come in here for a second, please?  Sheila, years ago,  you did some work for this company  that went uncredited  and we would like to fix that.
Here's the check you should have been paid 40 years ago.
Inflation not included.
Oh, thank you, gentlemen.
How do I cash it?  No, you don't.
It's, uh ceremonial.
Do I take the whole thing to the bank?  No, Sheila, don't cash it.
It's for you to have.
- Just put it on a wall so - Oh!  And we have another surprise for you!  I found Tim and Sam's April D video.
And it really sucks!  There's no way it sucks.
April in the D.
April in the D.
3 Ds.
What are you laughing at?  Sorry it's not Bing Crosby.
One dream.
3 teams.
3 beats.
One dream.

No, mm-mm, no.
He's not wearing that suit.
That suit's wearing him.
Thanks for coming in.
- Yep, great job.
- We'll let you know.
Jefferson, we can wait till they leave the room  before we say anything.
I ain't go time for that.
Oh, no, absolutely not, no.
His butt's too big.
I need a butt, not a birdbath.
Do you at least want to see the poses?  Hell no.
Please leave the room butt first.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I am unimpressed.
Well, it's a process, Jefferson.
We'll get there.
Yeah, I mean, you liked Russell.
Why don't we just go with him?  No, no, no, we need two, all right?  Haven't you ever seen a suit commercial?  He needs somebody to lean on, to laugh with.
- Am I wrong? - No, you're not wrong.
I mean, am I crazy?  Have any of these other guys been any good?  No, you're absolutely right.
I mean, I just don't get it, you know.
How hard is it to, like, walk into the room and be, like,  boom, and give one of these, like, or like this?  Whoa.
Sam, that was really good.
Why don't we just have Sam do the commercial?  [LAUGHS.]
Me?  Yeah, I mean, you'll already be there.
Those poses were fantastic.
Why don't you just do the commercial?  Jefferson?  Mm, good look, nice smile,  strong hairline.
Turn.
No red flags on the butt.
- I'm in.
- Great.
Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do it.
All I have to do is, like, kind of, like, just do one of these.
No, do not do that.
That is not good.
No, I know, yeah.
Walk straight, man!  Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    [FUNKY MUSIC.]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   And you're gonna take all this chalk off  when you're done, right?  Look, Emilio, I don't ask, and there's chalk on the suit  during the commercial, I'm the one getting yelled at,  not you, bud.
Oh, Tim, I don't know about this.
I mean, I like being behind the camera, you know,  the man with the ideas.
Sam, you are going to be so great.
If you believed in yourself half as much as I do,  you'd be on the moon right now.
What, from, like, modeling? What do you mean?  I just believe in you.
Why don't you get out of my friggin' ass?  Sheila and I are going to lunch.
No boys allowed.
[CHUCKLES.]
Okay, Sheila.
It's girls only.
And no, we're not that way.
[LAUGHS.]
Hey, guys, we should do an all-boys' lunch.
Close the door, Tommy.
Just gonna get a quick close on that.
Shut the door, bud.
Then when I got home, someone stole my parking spot.
Did you put your chair down?  - Yeah, they moved it.
- Assholes.
I hope you keep their car.
- I did one better.
- Mm.
I put sardines in the gas tank.
Does that do anything?  What do you think?  - No? - Oh, you're bad.
You're bad.
Hey, girl.
Forget something?  Thank you.
Sheila, this is my girlfriend, Scarlet.
Hey, Sheila.
I've heard a lot about you.
It's very nice to meet you.
I'll let you guys enjoy your lunch  after I steal this chip.
- Mwah! - Thanks, honey.
See ya.
She seems nice.
She's the best.
Back in the office when I said, "We're not that way,"  it was funny, because you are gay, and we both knew it,  and neither of us is a bigot.
[FUNKY MUSIC.]
Whew, all right.
Well I guess I'm ready.
You are going to be great.
Just don't forget about us little people  when you're big-time.
Oh, shut up, Tim.
All right, let's shoot this puppy.
Ready?  And action.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC.]
- Cut.
- Great.
Really good.
Mm.
- Moving on.
- Whew, felt good.
And action.
And cut.
And oh, you know what?  Let's keep rolling and see what he does.
And there it is.
Cut.
- Wow.
- Very good, Sam.
Moving on.
That was great.
Whew.
The look of Jefferson Porger Menswear,  fashions for the male,  a professional, tailored look with classic style.
From collar tips to wing tips, Jefferson Porger has it,  a casual, cool look for a night out.
Jefferson Porger has the sports coat to fit your style.
Jefferson Porger has the look you want.
The camera loved you, man.
Oh, thanks, buddy.
You know the part where I point to the document in the folder?  Yeah.
I almost cracked up.
Yeah, I saw that, but that's just because I know you.
Jefferson Porger suits.
Get over here, man.
[CHUCKLES.]
Wow, man, a celebrity right in my lobby.
- Ahh, thanks, Ned.
- No, man, I'm serious, man.
I'm very proud.
I'm sitting there with my girl watching TV,  all of a sudden, you come out of nowhere.
I'm like, "Oh, shit, baby.
"  I know him.
"  She was like, "Bullshit.
"  I'm like, "Bitch, get out.
"  "Get your shit and get out of my house now.
You don't tell me who I know.
"  But you killed it.
Thank thank you, Ned.
Are you okay, man?  Me? [CHUCKLES.]
Mm.
I am fine.
[LAUGHS.]
I am fine.
Fine.
It's about you today.
This is your day.
This is Sam day.
- Okay.
- [LAUGHS.]
It's Sam day, man.
- All right, man.
- You take it easy.
- You too.
- Keep killin' it.
I thought you were gonna tell him it was my idea  to put you in the commercial.
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
- No, it's cool.
It's all good.
Yeah, Ned, I wrote that commercial.
What did you write, like, "guys wearing suits?"  [LAUGHS.]
Yeah.
- [APPLAUSE.]
- Oh, come on.
- Congratulations.
- There he is.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Come on.
All right, the star's got some real work to do.
Come on.
Sam, what's it like to be on TV?  Oh, come on, Sheila, the same as everything else.
Amazing.
[LAUGHTER.]
Dude, come on.
You were in one commercial.
We got real work to do.
Ahh, well, back to the grunt work.
Yeah, the stuff that actually pays the bills around here.
Lea, do you know any Polish jokes?  - No.
- 'Cause I'm Polish.
And it's okay if you said them, because, you know,  I'm Polish, and I know you know it.
That's why it's funny.
I don't know any.
Here's one.
How many Poles does it take to screw in a light bulb?  - How many? - Five.
Because four of them are putting it in the wrong hole.
Nope, because it's all right.
There is no wrong hole.
You could put it in any hole you want.
It doesn't matter.
I'm not a bigot.
Okay, so boom, a club for teens.
I was thinking we could focus on the fact that, like,  kids are cool; adults are lame.
So we'd open on, like, a teenager going up to the bar  ordering a pop.
He holds it up, looks to camera, and goes,  "I could get used to this place.
"  Ha-ha-ha-ha.
You know what? Let me just feel it through.
Just gonna see, like, if it feels natural for the actor.
No.
Mm, no pop, definitely no pop.
You know, it's hard to, like, remember that when we're typing  this stuff out and, like, writing it,  like, an actor has to actually perform it and,  like, make it feel natural.
- You know what I mean? You know? - Yeah.
Yeah, no, I forgot that.
You know, what if he's, like, walks through,  you know, like, taps the girl on the shoulder, and he's like,  "Huh, sure beats detention, huh?"  [LAUGHS.]
Yeah, that's good.
It feels, like like, a little less written,  which I think is what I like about it the most.
What kind of shoes do you think this boy is wearing?  Fff.
Back here ooh, it's Adidas, definitely Adidas.
Put Adidas.
Can you put Adidas? Or A-di-das.
He could be British.
[IN BRITISH ACCENT.]
Hello, chap.
Beats detention, doesn't it?  [FUNKY MUSIC.]
Sam, great job in that commercial, man.
[LAUGHS.]
Thanks, Q.
Oh, it was Tim's idea to put me in it.
Ahh, yeah, there I was in my office all eyes on me.
We needed a decision yesterday  Hey, Sam, is that one of the suits from the commercial?  Yes, it is.
Jefferson Porger gave me this card.
I get free suits till Christmas.
Whoa, you get one of those?  Yeah, no.
No perks for writers.
Ooh, Russell, look at you.
- How you doing, baby? - Good, man.
Ahh, how was rehearsal?  Really powerful.
Lavinia, the director, is a genius.
- Russell's in a play.
- Oh, no shit?  Sam, you should get into stage acting.
- Oh, I couldn't.
- You've got the presence.
- Ohh.
- You'd be great at it.
I I've actually been saying  Sam should do stand-up for years.
- He's really funny.
- Well, stand-up isn't acting.
It's true.
Quintin, can we have some beers?  Russell, you want a beer?  Vodka.
Calories.
Oh, that's a good call.
Quintin, can we have two vodkas  and one beer for my chubby little friend here?  A little bit of vodka maybe to lose some of that  Look at you!  [UPBEAT MUSIC.]
Hello, young lady.
Is this the audition for Tom Cruise's twin brother?  No, it's for schlubby nerd number one.
Oh, no, I know.
I was joking.
Yeah, I know.
They all told the same joke, every one of them.
Hey, fellas.
I see they rounded up the usual suspects.
- Sit down.
- [ELEVATOR DINGS.]
Good morning, Sheila.
Good morning, Lea.
How is your partner, Scarlet?  - She's great.
- Wonderful.
I hope she's not the jealous type,  'cause I put a little gift in your office for you.
It's something I bought ages ago and always meant to put up.
Thanks.
[ELEVATOR DINGS.]
Hey, young lady.
Is this the audition for Tom Cruise's twin brother?  Sit down.
[FUNKY MUSIC.]
Come on in, Steve.
Now, let's pretend that this couch is boom  Detroit's premier teen dance club.
So you'll just come out and say your line  whenever you're ready.
Hey, you kids can't party in here.
Thanks for coming in.
- Uh, maybe.
- Yeah, seems fine.
Andrea, maybe is not good enough.
You should know in your heart that this is  the perfect person for this role.
Do you feel that way?  - No.
- Yeah, okay, me neither.
I'm sorry.
I just wish these guys could do it.
It's not that hard.
All you have to do is just stand here and say,  "Hey, you kids can't party in here.
"  Okay, should we see another one?  Yeah, if you want to waste your day, I'll watch more.
But I'm sorry.
I just wish that I could, like,  somehow put myself in their body and show 'em how to do it.
It's easy.
It's just, "Hey!"  You kids can't party in here!"  Well well, maybe one of you should just do it.
- Yeah, maybe.
- Sam?  - Yeah, sure.
- No, the guy has to be white.
That's the thing.
Uh, okay.
Uh, well, uh, maybe Tim should do it.
- Oh.
- Yes, Tim should do it.
I mean, ugh.
Yeah, you did Jefferson Porger.
It's a little uneven, 'cause this is, like,  lines and, like, a character and stuff, but  Okay, what do you think, Andrea?  Whatever.
Guys, I was fine with all of them.
A nerd says we can't party.
Can we just pull the trigger here?  Cool, yeah.
You want me to do it, I'll do it.
[KEYBOARD CLACKING.]
So I'm going to be in a commercial.
It should be fun.
It was Sam's idea.
I play a schlubby nerd  who doesn't want these teens to party.
Although I'm not totally sure he should be entirely a nerd.
Tim, just be careful.
What does that mean?  It means I love you.
Good night.
What do you mean, be careful, though?  Chrissy.
Chrissy.
- Chrissy.
- Shake me again and see what happens.
Sorry.
I know that you're tired, but why do I have to go to bed?  Hey, buddy, I saw the new script on my desk.
Oh, yeah, I just did a quick rewrite last night.
Just tweaked a few things so they felt  a little more natural for me.
Yeah, um, did you give yourself a bigger part  and make yourself cool in this?  No.
Where's it say that?  "Mr.
Groove wears a fedora and pulls it off great.
"  He didn't have a name before, so I just  You named him Mr.
Groove.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
[FUNKY PERCUSSIVE MUSIC.]
So, Lea, what do you think about Queen Latifah?  Sheila, we don't have to keep talking about this.
I'm sorry.
I just don't want you to think I'm racist against gays  just because I'm old.
I know you're not racist against gays.
You made a bad joke.
Let it go.
The more you overcompensate, the more I think that you  actually are uncomfortable.
I understand.
You're right.
Sheila  you left these at my place last night.
I love you.
Sheila, did you do this to make me think  that you were gay?  - She's my neighbor.
- Oh, my God.
That was before the overcompensating conversation.
Do you want to invite her to lunch?  No, she drives me nuts.
[LAUGHS.]
Go home, Ann.
[FUNKY MUSIC.]
Okay, uh,  so in this commercial, you guys are gonna  be trying to come into this club to dance,  and this guy here is gonna say,  "Hey, why don't we dance together?"  And you all  will think it's a great idea, okay?  - Is that good? Cool? - Yeah, sounds good to me.
- Yeah, great.
- Let's shoot one, huh?  It's gonna be fun.
All right, and action.
Hey, kids, let's party together.
[TOGETHER.]
Yeah.
I for sure want to party with this guy.
Well, then, all right.
And cut.
Good job.
Awesome.
That was really, really good.
- Sam.
- Great job, guys.
- Sam.
- Yeah, uh-huh.
- What is that? - Oh, here come some notes.
Flying in notes; this is all part of his process.
[WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY.]
Yeah, okay, great job on that last one, guys.
I'll tell you what, we've got to do it one more time,  because I had a little sound issue.
The boom was in the shot.
You could see it.
Dang it, Tommy.
Tommy, come on.
So let's do it one more time, and just so we have it,  all right, Lea, we can do it  again, but this time,  maybe it would be fun if you said  they can't come in and dance in the club, so, you know,  so we have it like we had in the original script.
Right, but my only thing is,  why wouldn't they want them to dance with him?  Like, they kind of see him as, like, a friend  and as, like, a guy they look up to.
He's also a peer.
Yeah, maybe I just think so that we had it at least  both ways so we could  - I'm not into the other way.
- Yeah, okay.
I've I've seen it.
I've seen that done before.
Uh  - Do you know what I'm saying? - Yeah.
Ah let's just do it the same way again then.
- Thanks.
Thanks, Sam.
- Yeah.
Awesome.
Same again, guys.
And ugh and action.
[UPBEAT FUNKY MUSIC.]
Hey, kids, you want to party together?  [TOGETHER.]
Yeah.
Yes.
I for sure want to party with this guy.
All right.
Give me some skin.
[LAUGHS.]
- And cut.
- Sam.
- Yeah, no, I know.
- Come on.
What's what's What's going on here? Is it just me?  [BOTH MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY.]
That was good for me, but one thing is,  the kid who's supposed to say,  "I for sure want to party with him,"  he's, like, kind of squinting his eyes.
It's, like, I don't really believe him.
Yeah, no shit, 'cause why would he say that?  This is supposed to be a commercial  for a club where teens can go and have a cool,  safe space to hang out.
And now it's a commercial where a bunch of cool teens  want to hang out with an adult,  who legally wouldn't be allowed in the club in the first place.
Yeah, that's the whole point, though.
He doesn't go into the club.
They just want him to.
Why would they want to party with a weird old man?  Who's a weird old man?  Honey.
Me?  How am I old or weird?  - Well, a fedora don't work - Strongly disagree.
- That jacket - Everybody shut up.
Watch this.
Hey, kids, if this wasn't a commercial,  this was real life, and I came up to you in a teen club,  would you dance with me?  - Tim, no.
- Shh, watch, shh.
Would you dance with me?  Stacy, Stacy, would you dance with me?  Betsy, dancing?  Hugo, what do you say, bro-bro, you dancing?  Miranda, if this wasn't a commercial,  this was real life, and we're at a teen dance,  Miranda, would you dance with me?  Okay, enough.
Either he goes or you're both fired.
You know what?  I think you're only left with one option, Andrea.
Come on down to Boom teen nightclub,  the premier teen club in metro Detroit.
Can we party with you, Mr.
Groove?  Pfft, I wish, because that is one cool club.
But it's just for teens.
[TOGETHER.]
Aww.
Hey, don't be so sad, teens.
You're gonna have a great time.
I wish Mr.
Groove was a teen.
Hmm, let me see what I can do.
[TOGETHER.]
Yeah!  Come to Boom, metro Detroit's premier teen club.
Tell 'em Mr.
Groove sent ya.
That was the commercial that led to the shutdown  of Boom teen nightclub earlier today,  where a swarm of middle-age men were arrested  for posing as teens attempting to gain entry.
When asked what they were doing,  the men said, "Mr.
Groove sent us.
"  Between you and me, it seems like that commercial  was telling old me how to sneak into a teen club.
I think we should have a policy where we're not in  the commercials anymore.
I think that would be best.
Yeah, it's just hard to remain objective  during the process.
Yeah, no, I know.
Like, you know, I thought Mr.
Groove was a terrible idea.
But then I got in front of camera,  and I became a friggin' pedo.
- Well, you weren't a pedo.
- Mr.
Groove's a pedo.
Yeah, thanks, bud, and actually, he wasn't even.
He actually became young Mr.
Groove.
He wasn't, like, old guy in a young guy's body.
He became a kid.
Yeah, I think you and I can both agree that was not clear.
- I concede that.
- Oh, come on.
I got to get me into Boom.
Oh, pretty please, make me a teen.
So we won't be in the commercials anymore.
Yeah, no, that's probably the new rule.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
Son of a bitch stole my space again.

Tim, it's your own friggin' fault, okay?  I you can be difficult to introduce new people to.
- Why? - Why?  [LAUGHS.]

Harsh?  Harsh?  Okay, Shannon, how are you?  - Uh - You look lovely.
Is that blouse from Ann Taylor?  - No.
- Well, someone should tell  Ann Taylor, because they have a very similar one.
What are you even trying to go for with this?  I shop for Chrissy at Ann Taylor.
I'm just saying, I think they'd be very interested  in knowing that someone's selling a cheaper version.
How do you know this one's cheaper?  'Cause I shop for Chrissy at Ann Taylor, idiot!  It could be nicer, dillweed.
It's not!  Um, nice to meet you, Tim.
I've heard lots about you.
All good things, I'm sure.
Yeah.
- Let's go say hi to my mom.
- Okay.
- What did you bring, slop? - No.
Come on, now.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    [FUNKY JAZZ MUSIC.]
Oh, my God, it's Shannon Coyne.
- That's Shannon Coyne.
- You got to be cool.
I'm being cool.
[SHUSHING.]
Wow, Shannon Coyne.
Oh, we grew up listening to your family's gospel music.
- Thank you.
- So what's it like  dating a celebrity?  Oh, I don't know, babe.
What's it like?  - [LAUGHTER.]
- Oh, Sam.
- She's talking about me.
- I know, I was joking.
How do you get up in front of all those people?  I would be so scared.
You know, actually I have stage fright,  so I get up there  and I close my eyes  and I  Sing from my heart   [LAUGHS.]
Yeah, would you like to take a selfie?  You know who that is?  That's Sam's girlfriend.
Hm.
I know.
He hid it from me for a month  because I'm too harsh.
Well, Tim, you can be harsh.
Maybe Sam just want to build something first  before you bulldozed it.
Bulldozed it?  I have been nothing but lovely to all Sam's girlfriends.
I was a perfect gentleman to Dump Truck Debra.
I've been nice to all of them.
Stupid Sarah, Dumb Beth,  Debbie "The Animal" Steel, the Worm.
- Tim.
- I was so nice to the Worm.
Would you listen to yourself?  You're harsh as hell.
Okay, if it's because I'm too harsh,  then how come he kept it a secret from the whole family.
He didn't tell your parents,  Aunt Lacey, your grandma, you.
Holy shit.
You knew.
Oh, my God, you all knew.
The whole family knew, and they lied to me.
They lied to my face!  - Well - You're a family of liars!  Big, fake liars!  Liar!  - Hey, girl! - I love your hair.
Welcome, welcome, one and all  to the Duvet family reunion!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
We got drinks and, of course,  we've got the annual basketball game,  which my team has won six years in a row.
Now listen, over 30 years ago,  I took over the position as grill master from my father.
Today it gives me great honor  to pass this on to my son,  Samuel!  Have you all met his new girlfriend?  Shannon Coyne!  Yes!  Good looks, personality, and lineage.
Yes, I'm telling you, she is the total package.
And she's a celebrity.
Come on up here, son.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Ah.
Thanks, Dad.
You know, this is an honor  I've waited for my entire life.
In fact, when I was 7, I wrote a speech  I bring with me every reunion.
- Should I read it? - ALL: Yes!  - Should I read it? - ALL: Yes!  - Should I read this here speech? - ALL: Yes!  Well, if you insist.
[LAUGHS.]
"Friends, Duvets, and guests,  "I am honored to be your grill master.
"It's an achievement I rank up there  with my black belt in tae kwon do"  Oop, never did that.
Let's see.
Oop.
Never did that.
"Quick thank you to Grandpa Charles.
"  He's dead.
Sad.
Uh, didn't do that.
"Marry Mom"?  - [LAUGHS.]
- I was 7, again,  when I wrote this, so  Still seems kind of old to want to do that.
Really should have looked over this at some point since then.
Oh, "And never getting in a car"  with a stranger"  'cause stranger danger.
"  Hmm? Never did that.
So and you shouldn't, so that's a good thing.
Kids, learn from it.
Ah, thank you!  Uh, yep.
Thank you very much, son.
[GROANS.]
All right.
I hope your bellies are empty  and you're ready for fun,  because the Duvet family reunion  has officially begun!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
[FUNKY JAZZ MUSIC.]
Medium rare for the gentleman.
And for the lady  - Ooh! - Well done.
- All right, man.
- Ange, you want a hot dog?  - [CLATTERING.]
- [WHOOSH.]
Whoo! Now that's a hot dog.
Am I right? Am I right?  Here you go.
You know your dad was supposed to be pass long  grill master to me.
But, see, I just quit drinking,  and so I got the shakes,  but I'm happier, healthier.
Oh! What you got there, man?  That smell like Crown Royal.
Ladies, may I?  Of course, sweetie.
Come on.
No paper bowls, huh?  Just cream corn touching everything?  Oh, we were just talking about how nice it is  that Sam could meet himself a gospel singer.
I heard the whole family sing at Chene Park.
- Beautiful.
- So talented.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah,  but there's really no way to tell.
I mean, it's not like you can boo a gospel singer.
No, she's she is so nice.
She's lovely, lovely.
But did anybody taste  the potato salad she brought?  I mean, I don't want to say it's bland,  but I saw a fly land on it,  fly away, come back with some salt.
- [LAUGHTER.]
- Tim! You're bad.
Potato salad? More like "poor" -tato salad.
[LAUGHTER.]
Yeah.
Look, look, look on the bright side.
At least we know Sam's gonna lose some weight.
Oh! [LAUGHTER.]
Too much she can't lose any weight  in that big ol' head of hers.
- Whoo! - [LAUGHTER.]
She walk by and I thought it was an eclipse!  [LAUGHTER.]
Aunt Lacey! Aunt Lacey's joining!  Let's just hope Sam likes doing neck rubs,  'cause that neck of hers is doing some work.
- Yeah.
- [LAUGHTER.]
Looking like a lollipop in knockoff Ann Taylor.
Yes! Yes, it is!  - It's knockoff! - I know.
[LAUGHTER.]
- Hey.
- Hi, Shannon.
Hope you're having fun.
[SOFT LAUGHTER.]
So, really, I'm happy for Sam.
She truly is a sweet girl.
Yeah, no, she's so sweet.
She's made of sugar.
Hope it doesn't rain;  she turns into a [BLEEP.]
puddle!  Timothy.
- That mouth.
- Mm-mm-mm.
We were having fun, but that's carrying it  a little too far.
I wasn't having fun.
Enjoy your meals all mushed together.
Sam.
Congratulations on becoming  grill master.
Go ahead with your insult, Chrissy.
- I don't have an insult.
- Why? Too dumb?  - I'm just surprised.
- Damn it.
You're brave enough to take on this responsibility  after you quit Dad's restaurant.
I was 15.
Nobody even cares about that anymore.
Daddy cares.
You quit the waffle station right in the middle  of Mothers' Day brunch.
People just pouring syrup on waffle batter.
- So sad.
- Dog food over there, Chrissy.
Why don't you go eat up? Hey!  Hurry it up up there!  Whoo, you call this well-done?  I took a bite out of it; it said,  "Ouch, you hurting me!"  [LAUGHING.]
She said it talked! [LAUGHS.]
Hey! Hey, you kids!  Don't go wandering off in them woods.
Might mess around and get snatched up  by the Fork Bandit!  Y'all don't know who the Fork Bandit is?  They don't know who the Fork Bandit is.
He was a kid, just like you.
He wandered off from a barbecue,  couldn't find his family,  and now he's a dusty crackhead with nothing but a fork!  Anytime today, Sam.
It's gonna be just a slight delay.
Sam gotta speed up.
This long line's driving me to drink.
Driving me to drink.
Hey, come on, now.
Look here.
This is a brand-new grill master.
We gotta give him a chance to find his way.
Flip six, son.
- Uh, yeah.
- In a little while,  he's gonna be out-grilling us all,  providing he don't quit.
[LAUGHS.]
I'm not going to quit, Dad.
You're not again, because now you are a grown man,  and this is a responsibility.
[CHUCKLES.]
Son, get rid of eight and nine.
They done.
- Hey, grill master.
- Hey, baby.
Mwah.
Babe, look at us.
I mean, me impressing your family,  you're grill master.
We're the hits of this party, babe.
Yep, everybody loves us and is happy with our performance.
That they are, and that they do.
- Give it to me.
- BOTH: Mwah.
Hey, Shannon.
Can I get a picture?  I have something better for you.
Leave a message   God is good   Whoo! [LAUGHS.]
For when they call.
Hey, guys!  There's paper bowls here.
New this year.
Good for dip, sides, whatever.
Look kind of fun.
Try 'em out.
No bowl, sweetie?  No bowls.
- Who's this? - My friend from school, Evan.
- How you doing, Evan? - Tim Cramblin.
Cramblin Advertising.
- You want to hear a joke? - No, I don't.
I just don't think a little kid's joke  is ever going to make me, an adult man, laugh.
Thanks, though.
Just don't have the life experience.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Uncle Tim?  Yes, sweetie?  Sometimes I think things  but I don't say them out loud,  'cause then people hear them  and they might hurt their feelings.
Oh, my God.
I am harsh.
I'm harsh!  Thank you.
Ooh.
[LAUGHS.]
It's okay, son.
I got this.
Don't worry about a thing.
Ah, Sam.
You got divorced.
You're not in the family anymore.
You got to give up that shirt.
Chrissy.
I am so sorry I called your family pig-faced liars.
Mm, thank you, baby.
And I'm sorry I said [BLEEP.]
in front of your mom.
- You did? - Yeah.
And Aunt Lacey and Old Shirley.
But I'm not that person anymore.
I am harsh.
I realize that now.
It took a weird little kid with a shitty joke I never heard,  but I'm gonna be a better man.
I love you so much.
- Mm.
- I love you too, baby.
Hey, girl! I like that hat.
Have fun, everybody.
Oh, and Sam?  Take it easy on your daddy.
I need him in tip-top shape today.
Oh! Gross! Mom!  Hey, be happy for me.
I'm gonna let you take it out first.
'Cause you're gonna need all the help you can get.
Let's ball.
What you got, Sam?  What you got, bro?  What you got? What you got? What you got?  Money!  - David! - [LAUGHTER.]
Look here, Sam.
Now, look.
When you're guarding somebody, you got to bend your knees  and put your hands in the air.
I know how to play defense, Dad.
Really? Then how come you let me bust this in your face?  - Whoo! - Yes!  - Sam, bounce pass.
- Coming your way, baby.
You don't call the kind of pass you're gonna do  before you do it.
I'm just having fun playing with you, buddy.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Ball game!  David!  Kick it! Kick it!  Kick it!  Wait a minute.
Reset, reset, reset!  I wasn't ready.
Come on.
Kick it! Kick it! Kick it!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Pass it, Sam.
It's out or your range.
No, it's not.
Here comes fade away.
Short.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Why don't you quit while you're behind?  I know you know a little thing about quitting.
I gave this boy a job, and then you know what he did, George?  Don't tell me he quit.
On Mothers' Day brunch!  That was 15 years ago.
Oh, look ya.
You're hot and bothered.
- Just talking trash, baby.
- Don't listen to him, Sam.
- Dunk on him! - I can't dunk.
Can't grill neither.
Why don't have another handle of whiskey,  you drunk old bitch?  Whoa.
Hey, Samuel.
An insult is just  "Is just a.
" You know what?  I don't care.
I friggin' quit.
- Oh, damn.
- Damn.
Whoa.
What the  That was a little harsh.
And I know, because I used to be harsh myself.
But I'm not anymore.
I'll go talk to him, gang.
Good game, everybody.
That's fun.
Hey, buddy.
I wanna let you know we're forfeiting the game.
We lost 'cause you kicked the ball.
Yeah.
Your dad was being an asshole.
I know, like, he can't just ever let anything just be.
He never just, like, let me do my thing.
Like, uh I mean, I own my own frickin' company.
No, we both own it.
Yeah, Tim, I mean, but for my point, can you just  - Yeah, no, just both own it.
- Yeah, we both own it.
- I know.
- Thank you.
I mean, like, 15 years ago, you know,  I'm behind the waffle iron,  and, like, he's just, like, right behind me,  like, "Waffle's overcooked, Sam.
"  Waffle's overcooked, Sam.
"  I mean, I just can't focus.
So I finally am just like, you know, I walked out of there.
I just, like, left, and then, like, before I left,  like, I turned my back and, like, I looked back,  I was like, "Happy Mothers' Day, you mothers.
"  Did you really say that?  I wish I did so much.
I think your dad's just hard on you,  because he knows you can do anything.
Anything.
I can't dunk, Tim.
I think you can, Sam.
If you're going to love me   - Dad.
- Samuel.
Sorry I kicked the basketball.
Ah, it's okay.
[CHUCKLES.]
It's just that Duvet family passion.
Makes for us to be great lovers.
I know.
You know, son,  when I give you advice  Or anybody for that matter  It's just because I know how to do things,  the best.
Yeah, Dad, just everything doesn't have to be  a teachable moment.
You know, you really shouldn't have called  your uncle George an old drunk bitch.
No, I know that.
You know, I know a lot of things.
In fact, some things you didn't teach me, believe it or not.
Yeah, well, whether I taught you or not, I know 'em.
That's not the point.
Test me, if you don't believe me.
- I bet I know it.
- Dad.
- Go ahead, test me.
- I bet you I know it.
- Dad.
- [LAUGHS.]
You know, son, you're gonna be a great grill master.
- I know I am.
- Just not this year.
Yeah, I know, that's fair.
[MEAT SIZZLING.]
Tim.
Hey, so  I know we didn't get a lot of time to talk earlier,  and I hate how we got off on the wrong foot,  but are you talking shit behind my back?  No.
Why, who said that?  Was it Aunt Lacey?  I may have said that a fly landed on your potato salad  and the fly complained it was bland.
Then he flew away, got some salt,  used the salt on the potato salad,  so it tasted good to him.
But I now realize that  although the joke was very clever, it was also harsh.
Yeah.
And I want to start fresh.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry Sam didn't introduce me to you sooner.
I guess he knew how intimidated I would be to meet you  because you're so important to him, so it's cool.
Sweet of you to say, but I'm pretty sure it's 'cause  he knew I was gonna be a big, giant asshole.
[LAUGHS.]
You're probably right.
Yes, I am right.
- Friends? - Yeah.
- All right.
- [CHUCKLES.]
Whoo! I'm doing work out there.
Hey! Now, that's a Duvet filet right there.
It's all yours, Dad.
[EAGLE SCREECHING.]
[DRAMATIC PERCUSSION.]
[IN SLOW-MOTION.]
Fork Bandit!    Cock-a-doodle-doo!  - Hey! - That crackhead stole my filet!  I'll be god-damned.
I thought I made that shit up.
Whoopsie-daisy.
That ain't apple juice; that's Hennessy right there.
Taste pretty good though.
- You see that? - You see his abs?  Yeah, I mean, you only get abs like that if you do crack.
Yeah, 'cause you're always running,  trying to get the crack.
Yep, running, jumping, swimming, climbing.
I mean, it's all cardio.
- Yeah, 'cause you gotta get the crack.
- It's the whole goal.
- It's their brass ring, baby.
- It's the main thing.
- It's crack.
- BOTH: It's crack.
We're all thinking the same thing.
In a way it's admirable, you know what I mean?  - Sure.
- It's like dedication  - to one thing.
- Sure, man.
You look good too.
You look good.
Name me one fat crackhead.
- Lou Dobbs.
- Yeah, that's one.
- Lou Dobbs is a fat crackhead.
- That's the one.
I want to thank y'all for coming  to another good Duvet family reunion!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
And I want to take this time to acknowledge my son, Samuel,  in his inaugural shift as the  new Duvet grill master!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
It is a job that I am confident  that he will grow into.
And, son, I just want you to know  I'm proud of you.
And the man you've become.
I am too.
Proud of you.
And the man you've become.
Same as your dad.
- Yeah.
-  For   He's a jolly good fellow   For he's a jolly good fellow   For he's a jolly good fellow   Which nobody can deny   [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
The best.
More than you   It is   More than me   Whoa.
We are family, like a giant tree   I'm not harsh anymore,  but getting up there and signing, that's a nuts move.
We are family   We are so much more   Than just you and I   ALL:  We are a family   Like a giant tree   Growing stronger, growing wiser   ALL:  We are a family   [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Whoo!  There's only one thing left to say:  Let's hustle!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Money!  Ah! Cash!  Marked price!  Cash! Money!  Microwave! Cash!  Three! Money!  David!  Ball game!

--- S02E04 ---
1 [UPBEAT, FUNKY MUSIC.]
This is delicious, Mrs.
Cramblin.
I know it's terrible, honey, but thank you.
No, he said it was delicious.
Oh, Trevor, do you wanna join us for Sunday dinner?  [SUCKS TEETH.]
No can do.
Trevor, your mother invited you to sit down.
- Sit down.
- Hey, uh, Jerry,  why don't why don't you eat my ass?  Rude.
What is he still doing in the house?  I thought he moved into the house  with, like, 15 of his friends.
It didn't work out.
They turned out all to be backstabbers and liars.
All 15 of them.
They were nasty to him.
- Boy needs a job.
- Jerry.
- He got fired from Le Shish? - My dad got him that job.
It wasn't his fault.
They were nasty to him.
They wouldn't let him choose what time he came in.
So he just didn't show up, is what you're saying?  Honestly, he has to sleep in  or he'll lose his voice.
Besides, he doesn't have time for a job.
He's very busy with Rochu.
What is Rochu?  Rochu is an Ultra Beast Trevor created.
Look at the beautiful pictures he makes.
Mom, don't put that on the fridge!  The details are fantastic, Chrissy.
Now, Rochu is the king of the Banglo people.
And he defeated Malgor in the Battle of Light.
- Oh.
- He's a Lich Priest.
Uh is that how you say it, Jerry?  Am I Lich Lich Priest?  I don't freakin' know.
It's a bunch of cartoons with their dicks out.
- Jerry! - They are, Sue.
Some artist.
Asked him to draw  a picture of his mother and me in Wings jerseys,  he gives me a freakin' drippin' hog.
Chrissy, you should see the details on that hog.
It's as if he's seen it.
Down to the veins.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    Oh, honey, that was great.
- I'll clean up.
- [ALL PROTESTING.]
No, no, no, stop.
No, no, no, stop, stop.
I said stop!  I said I'd clean up.
- Put it back! - Yeah.
Here.
Give me that.
Sam, you got two answers  when a woman tells you what to do.
"Okay," and "Yes, honey.
"  Is that Tim Allen?  - Yes, it is.
- Oh, okay, yeah.
Excuse me, I'd like to sit down, please.
[SCOFFS.]
I was sitting here first.
- I don't care.
- This is the spot I want.
- I don't care.
- Well, there it is.
- Move - So.
Ohh! [COUGHING.]
You only hit me in my stomach after I just ate,  - you frickin' idiot! - Then I'll never get to  - hit your fat ass.
- Ohh.
Well, you shouldn't hit,  - you bag of bolts.
- Whatever.
God, I miss freakin' Shanahan.
Mom, you can't just let Trevor  move back into the house  every time he screws up.
Tim, he isn't like you.
You weren't here for the divorce.
That affected Trevor.
He was 18.
He should've already been out of the house.
I don't know what to do.
I'm trying.
Him and Jerry are at each other's throats.
Trevor tosses him around like a ragdoll.
He has your father's strength.
He hit Jerry in the back of the head with a chair  and then Rock Bottomed him.
- He Rock Bottomed him? - Yes.
That's a finisher.
He needs motivation.
Like you.
What if you gave him a job at the office?  - [GROANS.]
- Show him how it's done.
Ah  Maybe some structure would be good for him.
And he could stay with you and Chrissy for a while.
- Oh! - Just to get him started.
Transition is very hard for Trevor.
- Oh, Mom.
- That way he could  go straight to work with you.
75 is a nightmare in the morning.
He hits traffic, he turns around  - and goes to the Taco Bell.
- Oh.
I'll run it by Sam and Chrissy.
- It'll be fine.
- Oh!  I could talk to him.
It'll be fine.
Oh, Timmy! Thank you.
You're a very good brother.
- Love you, Mom.
- Very good.
[PLAYING KEYBOARD.]
Hey, bud.
What's up?  Do not enter without knocking.
Go back out and try again.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm already in here, Trevor.
That's stupid.
Hey, um, Mom told me that you were in between jobs  and we have an opening at Cramblin Duvet.
Oh, what happened? Did Sam get chronic diarrhea and die?  No, don't even joke about Sam's death.
We're gonna die at the same exact time.
Even if we're miles apart, our hearts will just know.
You can stay with me and Chrissy.
I think we could really use your help around the office.
You know, I could show you how it's done.
Actually, I don't need to be shown how it's done.
I know how it's done.
Well, you don't know how it's done,  but I think with a little bit of work,  you'd be pretty good at it.
Yes, I do know how it's done  and I could do advertising in my sleep.
You're actually not good at advertising.
You've never done it before,  so how would you know if you're good at it?  I do know how to do it.
Okay, well then, do it, then.
Fine, shithead! I'll do it!  Do not call me a shithead!  I'm giving you a job, a place to live!  Oh, my God.
Wow, thank you so much.
- Oh, thank you! - Oh, Mother Theresa!  - I need to offer my body to you.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
Okay, come on.
Let's go!  - Grab your stuff.
- What?  Come on, Trevor.
What you need to pack, don't you?  - Oh, my God.
Yeah.
- Don't you need  - to pack some stuff, buddy? - I gotta pack, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I gotta - Don't hit the dresser!  - Shut up! - That used to be yours  - as a baby! - That's my dresser!  Trevor, pack your deodorant.
Pack your deodorant I got you for Christmas!  Thank you!  You don't need your Slipknot mask.
- Yes, I do! - When are you gonna use it?  Take a shower.
You take a shower in a Slipknot mask?  - Yes! Shut up! - You shut the fuck up!  [BOTH SCREAMING.]
Morning, Sheila.
Gentlemen.
Trevor! My favorite Cramblin.
A flower for the lady.
Here you go, ma'am.
Oh, ohh, Trevor, just like your father.
It's been a while, but I've kept  your favorite game in my desk all these years.
Oh, my God! A frickin' a Game Guy?  - Yes! - Hey, guys.
Tommy, this is my brother, Trevor.
Nice to meet you, Trevor.
Hey, Tommy.
What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's  up?  - What's up? - Has Tommy never heard  the phrase, "What's up?" before?  I mean, he seems pretty frickin' rocked.
Hey, Lea.
What's up?  What's up?  Jake Tipper from Tipper's Jewelry  is in your office waiting.
Great.
Trevor, you wanna sit in on this one,  see how it's done?  Whoa.
I mean, Tipper's Jewelry seems  pretty big for Trevor's first day.
Oh, he's gonna be fine.
He's just gonna watch.
- Won't say a word.
- Unbelievable.
Hear that, Trevor? Don't say a word in here.
- Yeah.
- Trevor!  - Hm? - Good luck, Trevor.
So then the guy gets down on one knee,  pulls out a jewelry box.
In it is a note that says,  "IOU one diamond.
"  And the woman looks at him and says,  - "Maybe I should reconsider.
" - [BOTH LAUGH.]
You owe it to yourself to shop at Tipper's Jewelry.
That's cute.
What? Okay, uh,  a girl's taking her friends out to lunch.
We pan around the table, and reveal all of her friends  are diamonds.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
[CHUCKLES.]
Eh.
- What? - We have we have other ones.
- Uh, this one's funny.
- He doesn't want  - funny ideas, idiots.
- Shut up, Trevor!  I'm sorry I'm sorry about that.
A diamond costs, what? Three months' salary?  - Wait, what are you - You think people  - wanna joke about that? - Go on.
Guy comes home from the store,  - he's carrying a grocery bag.
- [SENTIMENTAL MUSIC.]
He opens up the door, he sees his wife,  she's holding the baby.
He reaches inside the grocery bag  and he pulls out a diamond pendant.
She's like, "Why? It's not our anniversary.
"  And he says, "I don't need a reason to give you a diamond.
"  Tipper's: She's the only reason you need.
[CHUCKLES.]
That's it.
And maybe the baby craps itself.
'Cause it should be a little bit funny, I think.
Ehh, that's perfect.
You've cut the shit out of your lip, sir.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ah, Sheila's got some tissues,  - if you just follow me.
- All right.
Price of having those rings, huh?  [CHUCKLES.]
- That was really good.
- Yeah.
You know who he reminds me of?  Yeah, your dad.
No.
I remind you of my dad.
- Yeah, but - Hey, guys.
What's up?  Tommy, I need you to get the frickin' hell out of here.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.
Trevor actually did really, really good today.
- He did? - Jake Tipper's gonna  use one of his ideas for a commercial.
- [VIDEO GAME GUNFIRE.]
- It was amazing.
- [EXPLOSION BOOMS.]
- Sam said he reminded him of me.
That's nice, but can you please tell him  - to turn that damn game down? - Yes.
Sorry.
- [GUNFIRE.]
- Hey, pal?  Great job today, but can you turn down  "Call of Duty," buddy?  It's "Battlefield," idiot.
I gotta hear people's footsteps.
You want me to get fragged like a noob?  It's just a game, Trevor!  No, it's not!  They use this to train NAVY SEALs.
Oh, so the NAVY SEALs play "Battlefield" all day?  - Yes, they do! - And that's how  they killed Bin Laden.
No, this is actually how they killed Bin Laden.
- Boom! - You don't fucking touch me  - ever, you piece of shit! - Ahh! Uhh! Uhh!  - Ow! Ohh! Ohh! - I didn't even touch you.
- Oh, my ahh! - There! That hard enough?  Ah! Ohh!  Get off my back!  Dumbasses.
I should kick both they  Can I just stay here a little bit?  [LAUGHS.]
Not on your fucking life.
[SIGHS.]
Well, I guess I'll leave if you can make me move.
What the frick ahh!  Ahh!  How are you so frickin' heavy?  - Ehh frickin' whale, go home! - Get off of me, Trevor!  - I can't! - Get the hell off oh!  Ahh! Ahh!  Get off me, you fricking psychopath!  Ugh! [SPITS.]

- Fine.
Stay.
But don't talk during my stories.

J.
Watkins on "The New Dance Show.
"  I always knew this we could do this.
- Let's do it.
- That's R.
J.
Watkins.
He's the host with the most.
Who cares? Shut up.
- You idiot! - You're gonna paralyze me!  - Ahh! - I'm gonna beat the  - Oh, my God! - Yeah!  - Oh! - Say what you will,  I've never hit you with a stick.
- Yes, you have.
- [FIGHTING SOUNDS CONTINUE.]
Oh, yeah, I have.
- You idiot! - Welcome to the jungle!  So we've cast a real life husband and wife team  to play the husband and wife in the commercial.
That way when they kiss, they can really go at it.
I don't want them to really go at it.
Yeah, uh well, not a problem.
I mean, we had 'em really go at it in the audition,  so we can pull back.
You know, I did have a question  about the grocery bag surprise.
Yeah, uh, what's the question?  Actually, where's the young man that  who came up with the idea?  Uh, I can go get him.
Just one second.
[SIGHS.]
Trevor!  Get in here!  Put your shirt on!  So Jake, I don't know if I made it very clear  when I was talking about the diamonds  are a girl's best friend commercial.
The diamonds would actually be animated.
You know, they would each be, like,  a different kind of personality.
Like, there'd be, like, an old lady, uh,  like, sassy old lady diamond.
And, like, a dumb diamond, you know what I'm saying?  Sit down.
Talk to him.
Here he is, Jake.
I was wondering if it shouldn't be a grocery bag,  but a bag from Tipper's.
That way, it's less confusing.
Yeah, I mean, we could do that.
Just kinda replace the grocery bag  with, like, a nice Tipper's bag.
That'd be better, in fact, I think.
'Cause that way, you know, it'll say Tipper's on the bag.
No, Sam, it's gotta be a regular, every day grocery bag.
It's gotta have this feeling that you can buy jewelry  at any time when you're coming home from the grocery store,  after you bought milk, egg, cheese, beef.
Yeah, like a a diamond in the ruffage, if you will.
- No.
- You don't say no to me  in the middle of the pitch.
I'm sold.
Grocery bag.
[LIGHT MUSIC.]
Hey, Chrissy.
I just wanna thank you for being so understanding  about Trevor.
I know he can be a pain in the ass,  but I really think this has been good for us.
Thank you, my sweetie  [BOTH SCREAM.]
Why so serious?  You freaking psycho!  Get out of my wife's pajamas!  - Make me pregnant! - You're not my wife, idiot.
- I wanna be pregnant! - I know my wife's not a clown!  - Yes! - I know my wife's not a clown!  Do me, please! Give me a son!  - I can't! - Give me a clown son!  [DANCE MUSIC.]

On the dance line.
Who's your favorite dancer?  - General Get down.
- He's a general.
- He's the best.
- Well, yeah.
General Get Down's great.
You know he's a bagger at Farmer Zack's?  And Millionaire Greg is Dad's mailman.
Who's your favorite?  I'd have to say Seductra.
Of course you like Seductra.
She's a really great dancer.
Mm-hmm.
Seductra can dance.
Uh, yeah.
Just a little bit.
- [SCREAMING.]
- Look at me!  Look at me, Trevor! I'm proud of you!  I'm proud of you!  [BOTH PANTING.]
You're more like Dad than I am.
And it kills me to admit that.
I'm proud of you, Slipknot.
Really?  Yeah.
Ohh!  [SCREAMING.]
Hey, babe.
You're up early.
Big day today.
Trevor's first commercial shoot.
Trevor! [CLAPPING.]
Let's go! Let's go, Trevor!  Up, up! Wakey, wakey, let's go, pal  Damn it!  Jizz.
Fucking jizz.
- Hey, Mom.
- Trevor told me  - you were nasty to him.
- Why didn't he show up?  Came crawling back to you? Couldn't take it?  You were supposed to show him the ropes!  Not work him to death! He's a kid!  He is not a kid, Mom!  And if you baby him his entire life, he's never gonna learn.
I went out on a limb for him.
At the risk of his health!  He's sick as a dog.
He told me he had to be at the shoot at 7:00 a.
m.
Even turkeys aren't up at 7:00 a.
m.
What time are turkeys up, Mom?  Don't you sass mouth me, Timothy Dale Cramblin.
I am here to pick up  his Slipknot mask, his "Battlefield" disc  and his "Five Nights at Freddy's" men.
Yeah, well, you should take his sheet too,  because it's caked.
I'm sure I don't know what that means.
Go get the stuff!  Jerry wants to leave the city before it's dark.
- He's terrified! - [HONKS HORN.]
All right, let's go, babe.
Yo.
How you doin'?  He didn't even have the balls to tell us to our face  that he was gonna bail on us.
[SCOFFS.]
You surprised?  That's all he's ever done.
How can you be so good at this job and not wanna do it?  What?  Nothing.
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, Sam.
Mail's here   Boo-yah!  What the hell is your cousin David doing here?  Oh, well, Tim, since I just found out  about the open door policy for hiring family members,  I figured it'd be okay for David to come work here.
You're not mad, are you? You can't be.
Yeah, all right.
I get it.
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
When you work at a company where two people own it,  all decisions need to go through both of 'em, bud, okay?  Yeah, you made your point, Sam.
- Okay, that's all I'm sayin'.
- Okay.
- All right? Okay? - All right, cool.
BOTH: Great.
Hey, David?  [YELPS.]
[LAUGHS.]
All right, you can go on home.
He got the point.
- Got what? - Tim got the prank.
So this isn't a real job?  Oh.
Um, just one second.
Joy.
Hey.
Yeah, the job's not real.
[MOUTHING.]
Yeah, it was a prank on Tim.
Okay.
- Don't wave to us.
- Yeah.
I'll do that.
Sure.
Guys  [SIGHS.]
please, please, please don't do this!  - I need this job.
- David, stand up.
You can finish up the rest of the week, okay?  Thanks, Sam.
I broke your stapler.
Hey, David.
What's up?  Just dumb.
We went the Pegasus.
I got a Wings jersey.
We even walked a block.
Wasn't bad.
That city's gotten okay.
In certain parts.
We were asked for change.
But the guy was funny, actually.
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Thank you.
Chrissy and I applied and got in to be  on "The New Dance Show.

[SIGHS.]
Enter.
What the hell, man?  You sneak back to Mom's in the middle of the night,  leave a puddle of rope on the bed?  It's my two weeks notice.
Trevor, you need to grow up.
You can't just run away from everything.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a pass.
You can come back and work for me.
[SIGHS.]
I tried it, I didn't like it.
It was stupid, it was dumb.
But you're so good at it.
It's easy.
It's your thing, man.
It's not mine.
What do you mean?  Look, remember when we were kids  and we would race and you were faster than me,  so you'd slow down and let me win?  - Yeah.
- It's like that.
Oh, my God.
You quit because you're better than me  and you didn't wanna make me feel bad.
Oh  Give me the Slipknot mask.
Give me Shawn Clown.
[SOBBING.]
Trevor!  When we were racing,  I didn't slow down so you could beat me.
I didn't slow down.
I just got tired.

Oh, thank you, Trevor.
And you know what? Yours was pretty good, too.
Although, it coulda been a little funny.
I mean, people remember the ones that are funny,  - in my experience.
- Yeah, so that's why  they did yours, right?  [WHISPERING.]
You piece of shit.
Take your hat off at the table, Trevor.
Hey, Jerry, why don't you suck my balls?  Take your hat off at the table, Trevor.
Let him wear his hat, Jerry.
No, Sue.
You think I don't wanna be here eating  with my Panama hat on?  Take the hat off.
Take the damn hat off.

And boom! My pants split wide open.
No underwear! Butt everywhere!  Man, it was so bad,  the principal had to give Sam his pants.
- [LAUGHTER.]
- I still have 'em.
- You do? - They fit! They fit!  [LAUGHTER.]
Well, I have a funny prom story.
- Yes! - Okay, okay.
So our theme was Under the Sea.
Except they put stars on the ceiling.
Well why would there be stars on the ceiling  if we're under the sea?!  [LAUGHING.]
Who does that, you know?  Uh, yeah.
I guess there wouldn't be  - No.
- Ha, ha!  Ah, man, hilarious.
Then I was voted prom queen, so, you know, so dumb.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
I love your hair.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, Chrissy does YouTube hair tutorials.
They're pretty popular.
Oh, I love YouTube!  Yeah, I have lots of videos on there  of me singing gospel songs.
So many views, it's embarrassing.
- So dumb.
- Totally.
And now it's time for Mort Crim's  Chump of the Week.
- Oh, here comes Chump.
- There we go! Morty!  This week's chump is my son's best friend Tucker.
If you're coming to someone's house for a sleepover,  you don't get a nosebleed.
That's all my stuff you bled on, Tucker.
Classic Chump.
Up next, watersports and weather.
If you want to save money   Oh, I love this commercial.
Well, it's one of ours.
You know that's Sam singing, right?  Really?  - You're so cute.
- Eh, actually I'm sexy.
Dime after dime   It's an undeniable fact   And it's always bargain time at Farmer Zack's   You get your nickels back   And it's always bargain time at Farmer Zack's   Who is that you're singing with?  Uh, you know,  I don't quite remember.
Something like that kind of is, like, can slip the mind.
Sam, that's Molly.
Is it, Chrissy? What a fantastic memory you have.
Yeah, we've been doing Sudoku puzzles  so we don't go nuts when we're old people.
And it's always bargain time at Farmer Zack's   Who's who's Molly?  Farmer Zack's   Just an acquaintance.
An acquaintance?  You used to call her your soulmate.
Ex-girlfriend.
I guess that's why you guys sound so passionate.
Ah, it's just a commercial, babe.
Who cares? I mean, it's not like I came.
- Ohhhh, man! - Sam!  What? I said I didn't come.
I don't normally comment on the commercials,  but that grocery store commercial  makes me just a little horny.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    [SMOOTH MUSIC.]
Yes, sir.
Ho, ho, shit!  [LAUGHING.]
Yeah, that is it right there!  Mm.
Oh, uh, can I Can I get a Whopper?  The hell's that? Is that some kind of joke?  Yeah, of course it's a joke.
I think it's funnier than you do, actually.
Well, Tim, I had this great idea.
It's just it kind of made me laugh.
I was like, what if  Get this we re-recorded the Farmer Zack jingle  with me and Shannon singing?  Ugh.
Shannon's jealous 'cause it's you and Molly.
No.
Shannon didn't even mention it once.
Yet.
But man, it's so awkward, you know.
It comes on all the time.
So let's re-record it.
Sam, people love that jingle.
Yeah, but they'll love the new jingle  even more.
Plus,  Shannon's a professional singer,  she's my girlfriend,  and we're doing it, so  Yeah, you know what? Fine.
But it's only because I want you and Shannon to be happy.
Thank you, buddy.
But tell me this, my friend  How's the sex?  We don't have to do that.
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
- It's a joke.
- Okay.
- It's all part of the - I mean  Yeah.
Crap, now I'm picturing you pumping.
Now I'm picturing you pumping.
For the life of me, I can't understand,  why would you steal Kotex?  Do you even know what they are?  Look at me!  Do you know what my daddy would do if he found me  stealing some Kotex?  He would beat my black ass.
You better look at me.
I ain't playin'.

Tomata, you're banned from the store.
Now get your ass outta here!  Better take that look off you  You take that look off your face.
- You can't steal, buddy.
- Ooh! Sam!  Hey, guys.
What can I do you for?  Randy, we think it's about time  you update that commercial of yours.
Are you crazy? People love that commercial.
Yes, they love it.
But it's outdated.
Yeah, times are changing,  and people want a grocery store that changes with them.
Let's walk! Tell me what you're talking about.
Let's walk, let's walk.
You got to check, because they be stealing the toys  in here, you know what I'm sayin'?  You put little ski masks in there,  you know what I'm sayin'?  Chocolate Duke, baby.
You can't [CHUCKLES.]
Yeah, well it's just Count Chocula.
Hmm?  Randy, we were thinking,  for the new commercial, we could update the song, uh,  with different prices for the holidays,  like, uh, "for the 4th of July,  hot dogs are 2.
99.
"  That price just blew my mind"  Mike!  Don't squeeze the melons like that, man,  I can smell your fingers on it!  I don't do that anymore.
I'm lookin' at ya, man.
No, I'm looking at 'em to buy.
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
My apologies, man.
Tsunami of apologies to you.
Okay, that's fine.
You can update the song,  but we gotta do something with this goddamn character.
- Yes.
- We gotta update him,  you know what I'm sayin'?  We need to get rid of this hat,  give him some black shades, and a  Like a black shirt, let his muscles pop out.
You want Farmer Zack to lose the straw hat  and have a tight black shirt?  - That's it.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we could do that, though.
That's what I mean.
Mike!  What you doing, man?!  - He just had his dick in a melon.
- Oh.
He's got his dick in a melon!  Oh, she's buying the dick melon.
- She's buying the dick ma'am! - Ma'am!  - Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am! - Ma'am!  A man had his penis in that.
I'll get you a new one.
Mm-hmm.
[SIGHS.]
- Oh, babe.
- Hm?  - Got some exciting news.
- What?  We just hired an amazing gospel singer  to sing the new and improved Farmer Zack's jingle.
Is it that raggedy bitch Bebe Jenkins?  Oh, no, babe, uh, it's I was talking about you.
Just trying to be sweet.
It's you.
Oh, my God!  Oh, my that'll be so much fun.
Babe, you're the cutest.
Ah, actually I'm the sexiest.
But yeah, we can re-record the jingle  and never hear the old one again.
Good.
Because you acted so weird  when it came on the other day.
Sam, I'm not bothered  by you and your ex being so sexual,  'cause  we can be sexual, too.
- Oh.
- And not just in the studios.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
Hey, YouTubers, it's your girl  Chrissy-Cross comin' at you  with that new hotness  A natural hair up-do.
Just follow the steps in this tutorial,  put on a dress that shows off your figure,  and get out of the house!  Why are you talking like that?  Dang it, Tim.
Get out of the shot.
Sam is gonna re-record the Farmer Zack's jingle  with Shannon.
- Really? - Mm-mh.
Sam and Molly had such good chemistry  in that song.
- And no offense to Shannon - None taken.
But it just won't be the same.
- I know.
- I mean,  she's a perfectly nice girl.
- Perfectly nice.
- But you can tell  when two people just aren't right for each other,  Yeah.
When Sam's around her,  he's completely lost his star factor.
- What? - His star factor.
That special something that makes you go from  a face in the crowd to a face in lights.
- You gonna tell him? - No.
I'm gonna pretend to be supportive.
Good for you.
Now get out of here.
I'm making a tutorial.
And don't cross through in the background.
Why not?  'Cause when you do,  people in the comments section roast you.
I mean, they light you up.
[SCOFFS.]
Like I care what people who watch your tutorials  say about me.
What is one?  "When did Chucky grow up and get ugly?"  Chucky grow up to get ugly?!  Chucky's ugly as a boy!  Bad logic.
Next.
[SIGHS.]
"Look like the McRib is back.
"  [SPUTTERING.]
How am I a McRib?!  I'm a man with a big old hog!  Put that in the video! I I don't care.
Ha, ha, that's I don't care.
Okay, then.
Hey, YouTubers, it's your girl,  Chrissy Cross, coming to  What you got to say about this right here?  Tim, no!  BOTH:  And it's always bargain time at Farmer Zack's   You'll get your nickels back   BOTH:  Yeah, it's always bargain time at Farmer Zack's   Farmer Zaaaa   Aaaack's   Oh, yeah, yeah   Yeah  Whoo!  In His name.
How was that?  That was great, babe.
- Good? - Great job!  Great job.
That wasn't sexy.
Not at all.
It was like feeling up a girl  and there's turds in her bra.
Turds in her bra? Why would she have turds in her bra?  It's a prank, idiot.
Ugh.
Farmer Zaaaa   Aaaack's   I don't like it, guys.
It's not making me horny.
- I'm sorry? - It didn't give me wood.
Look.
No wood.
Flat as a board.
You know?  Well, that's a piss dot right there.
Sometimes when I urine, I don't stop it all the way.
And, you know, it comes out on my clothes.
I mean, I don't know what you guys did.
You did something different, but  Well, actually, we brought in a professional singer.
Mm-mm.
Bring back that nice lady.
- What's her name? - Molly.
Yeah.
About this farmer thing.
Yeah, we gave him the tight black shirt,  and we gave him the cool sunglasses.
Good.
But you know what I'm thinking?  Leather pants.
Farmer Zack's gonna wear leather pants?  And  a black trench coat.
Yeah, we can do all that.
Thanks, guys.
Well, this sucks.
I mean, re-recording the song with my ex-girlfriend's  gonna be much more awkward.
Yeah, I completely agree.
I mean, the Shannon and me version  is better than the Molly and me version.
- Technically.
- Yeah, technically.
I just Randy's probably just coming from a place  where he feels the other version was more fun.
Yeah, I see that.
But the version with Shannon was great.
- [TOGETHER.]
Technically.
- Technically it is.
- Technically.
- Technically.
[GROOVY MUSIC.]
Hey, pig.
Get ourselves some lettuce and tomato,  and we got ourselves a BLT.
Careful.
Before I turn this body cam off  and go to town on your ass.
You ain't wearing a body cam.
Whoops.
[LAUGHTER.]
There she is.
How are you, Molly?  - Hey, good.
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you too, Tim.
- Yeah.
Sam, you're looking well.
And sexy, I know.
Molly, I need to talk to you.
I'll give you some space.
Molly, we're shooting a new Farmer Zack's commercial.
And we need you to sing the jingle again.
- With you? - Yeah, with me.
Like last time?  Hey, babe.
Like last time.
My name is Tim.
Well, I ain't seen anything pretty as you  in about a minute or two.
[CHUCKLES.]
Doubt it.
Shut up.
Sorry, Tim.
It's fine.
I actually need this right now.
Somebody called me Chucky on the Internet.
Like a handsome version of Chucky?  [LAUGHS.]
You.
Shut up.
[GIGGLING.]
Sam, the last time we sang that song,  we were in love.
Yeah, we almost got engaged.
I put a ring in a piece of cake.
I ate the cake.
And then, when we went through your stool,  there were two diamond rings in there.
That's how I knew you were cheating on me.
Sam, I'm still so sorry about that.
We don't have to go down that road.
Just re-record the jingle with me, okay?  Yeah, sure.
I figure I owe you one.
Molly? Can I get your set of keys?  He wants to get let out of there.
He wants to get a better look at my body.
No! He murdered someone.
Ricky!  It's bargain time at Farmer Zack's   [GIGGLES.]
Farmer Zack's   - It's just so catchy.
- [MUMBLING.]
If you wanna save money   Maybe that's enough singing for tonight.
Hey, YouTubers, it's that Chrissy-Issy-Issy  coming at you with another hairstyle  "I love your tutorials,  but your husband's not hot enough for you.
"  Disagree.
"Gross husband.
" Disagree.
"This girl's married to the Penguin.
"  No, she's not! Disagree!  "Watch out, Chrissy, there's a fat ghost in your room.
"  Bullshit!  [EXHALES.]
[GRUNTS.]
Listen up, society.
You are now ordered  to cease and desist the teasing  of one Tim Cramblin.
We are the agents of chaos.
Stop teasing him!  Tim, you clogged the toilet again.
As if.
Stop putting baby wipes in the toilet.
- Shut up.
- What?  Nothing.
Sorry, sweetheart.
Yeah.
I love the trench coat,  the tight muscle shirt,  the leather pants  Oh, the shades, the shades.
Yeah.
You know what'd be really cool?  If we made him black.
Yeah.
Hell yes! And you know what?  I wouldn't be mad if he had a sword.
Yeah, but Tim, what if Molly and I  reach the same depths of sexuality as last time?  I mean, that would be cheating, right?  Yeah, it would, but you'll be fine.
I mean, I dressed down to look less attractive.
Sorry, bud.
You look like a friggin' smoke show.
I know.
I'm a hot piece of ass.
- Perfect ten.
- Mm-hmm.
Girls want to bang me, and guys want to be me  being banged by them.
Sucks.
Maybe I shouldn't do this.
Calm down.
It's just Molly.
[ELEVATOR DINGS.]
[SENSUAL JAZZ MUSIC.]
Some women can make a man     A very good wife   But let me tell you, crooked woman's   Not worth the sacrifice     Oh well, I don't want no   Crooked wom  Hi, Sam.
Hey, Molly.
You look great.
Thanks.
I was in a prostitution sting.
High-end.

Is there something wrong with the song?  No, uh well,  we did have to re-record the song with Molly.
But it's only because the  The client thought there was no spark in ours,  which is kind of my point.
There's, like, no spark here.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I never said my balls came out, okay?  I mean, they did.
Got a huge laugh.
Look, Shannon, you're perfect.
But we're not perfect for each other.
And I don't think either of us should settle  for anything less.

That must've been hard.
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.
She was sweet.
And Mom and Dad will be crushed.
But ten years from now,  you don't want to wake up and realize  you married the wrong person.
- Yep, yeah.

Chrissy's right.
She could've turned out  to be a child molester.
- What? - What?  Well, I'm just I'm just saying,  Chrissy's saying, ten years is a long time.
A lot could happen.
She could turned into a child molester.
That is not what I'm saying.
Tim, how do you "turn into" a child molester?  Uh, you get molested by one, Sam.
It's not like getting bit by a werewolf.
Uh, whatever, I'm just agreeing,  Mom and Dad are gonna be crushed.

Ah-ah-ah, this one gonna twist your drawers up.
Ready for this? Onion rings: French fries  with pussy holes.
- Whoa.
- Hold on, guys.
Need you to sign in, man.
Sir, I need you to sign in.
Sir?  Sir.
Sir!  Aren't you going to stop him?  All I can do is three "sirs.
"  He looked all right, though.
Glasses  - Yeah, it's fine.
- All right, cool.
Christmas, right?  Actually, Ned, we gotta go.
We're gonna miss "Chump of the Week.
"  Oh, love "Chump of the Week," man.
You think he might do the one about my man  who got the kangaroo in his apartment?  No, that was last week's chump.
They don't repeat.
Come on, Tim, we gotta go.
And now it's time for Mort Crim's  "Chump of the Week.
"  - Just in time.
- Shh.
You know who pissed me off?  Dale Stern, the principal of Diana Lewis Elementary,  who permanently cancelled pizza Fridays.
Now, if pizza's not healthy,  how come I've never seen a fat Italian?  You, sir, are a pepperoni.
And you are my "Chump of the Week.
"  [LAUGHS.]
Chump.
Good luck getting an omelet in this town  without a pube in it.
Yeah, yeah, more like,  good luck trying to get a pepperoni in this town  without a pube in it.
How's that better?  Good night, Detroit.
I'm Mort Crim, and that's all the news  from the entire world.
Dude, well, then you date her.
Listen, bro, she made chicken  in front of a chicken.
The chicken was looking at me like I was crazy.
I'm like, fam, I don't know what to tell you.
So, now I got the chicken in my house  and now I can't eat chicken Oh, yo!  It's the kangaroo man.
Yo, sir, what's in the pouch? Can I fight it?  I'll beat the shit out of this kangaroo.
[DRAMATIC MUSIC.]
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    Like I said, man, I just keep seeing it.
There was like, five or six of 'em,  all women, all big as hell,  big ass backs, big ass titties, too.
They all had the same scorpion tattoo on their neck.
They was like, "Who do you work for?  Who do you work for?"  I'm looking like, "The goddamn U.
S.
of A.
"  And they was like, "Oh!"  And then one of 'em grabbed my  Whoa, what happened, Ned?  [SIGHS.]
I left the door open last night  and somebody snuck in here and robbed us.
I was at home.
Oh, crap, my leather jacket!  - We were robbed.
- My jacket.
They took the copy machine and all the paper.
They didn't take my jacket.
They took my laptop.
Look, it could have been a lot worse.
All right? It's just a laptop.
They took her laptop but not my beautiful jacket?  This robber's a dork.
They stole my work Scotch.
Sheila, we can get you new Scotch, okay?  The important thing is that nobody was hurt.
Sam, they stole your top hat.
With the holly?  What is wrong with this city?  Maybe they didn't see the jacket.
Yeah, but they definitely would have smelled it.
It's brand new.
It stinks.
That's true.
It stinks bad in here.
It certainly does.
It certainly does.
So, what we were thinking was, we open the showroom  of Garner Weich Furniture, you know,  see chairs, we see sofas.
Then we land on the two of you  sitting in a loveseat, talking directly to camera.
Oh, no, we don't want to be in the commercial.
Oh, really?  We think you guys would be great.
We're afraid people will recognize us  from our user-submitted PornHub video.
Pardon me real quick, I have to check my email privately.
Uh, okay.
Well, in that case,  we hire a spokesperson.
Oh, what kind of spokesperson?  Could be a sports figure, a character actor.
I guess the question is,  who do you want representing your company?  [CHUCKLES.]
Seriously?  We would like someone with integrity,  someone that people can trust,  someone with gravitas.
Could it be an animal?  Uh, yeah, that'd be great,  but we're not allowed to work with animals anymore.
What happened?  We glued two bugs together for an exterminator commercial.
Why?  To make it look like they were kissing.
And Mort Crim doesn't usually comment  on commercials, but he called it a "bummer.
"  Hey, what about Mort Crim?  - Oh.
- He called it a bummer.
The words just came out of my mouth.
No, no, what about Mort Crim for the commercial?  [BOTH LAUGH.]
[LAUGHING.]
That's  [LAUGHING.]
Eat shit.
[LAUGHING.]
Yeah, Mort Crim?  You don't like him?  No, we love him.
It's just, you're not gonna get him.
He's freaking Mort Crim.
Yeah, I mean, if you're Nike,  but it's not gonna happen.
- It's impossible.
- Hey.
If you would've told me that someday  I would be married to this incredible woman  and live in the nicest house in Bloomfield Hills  and have these muscles,  I wouldn't have believed you.
In my experience, gentlemen,  anything is possible.
- [MUMBLES.]
- Yeah.
You know what?  - We'll try.
- We believe in you.
- Oh, cool, that should help.
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- Great.
Thanks for coming down.
Appreciate it.
- Absolute pleasure.
- Drive safe driving home.
[DOOR CLOSES.]
She stomps on his balls.

- Oh, my God.
- I know.
- Let me see it.
- Yeah, here you go.
- No! - Ooh!  - Bad boy! - Ooh.
Tim, that jacket stinks like shit.
Yeah, well, I'm wearing it, so deal with it.
I'm going to meet Mort Crim.
You can't lock a goddamn door?  These criminal masterminds didn't break a window.
They didn't scale a wall.
They walked in an unlocked door.
- [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS.]
- I am so sorry, ma'am.
Ma'am?  Oh.
Do I look like your momma?  Do I look like the one who held your head  in the bathtub till all the brain cells disappeared?  I ain't your momma.
Wanda? It's really not that big of a deal.
We just lost a top hat and a printer.
Well, not just a top hat, asshole.
It had a sprig of holly in it.
Well, I thank you for your input, sirs.
Have a wonderful and safe day.
We at Emperor Security value your input and your things.
Thank you so much.
And take it easy on Ned.
He's the nicest security guard.
Well, thank you.
That's wonderful to hear.
Yeah, great.
[CHUCKLES.]
They love you, huh?  Aren't you Mr.
Popular?  Oh.
Oh, you're Joe Cool.
You're Snoopy with the sunglasses.
You screw up one more goddamn time,  and you'll be back-checking hand stamps at Chuck E.
Cheese.
I got to get myself together baby   Yeah   Get myself together     Uh, two beers, please.
Say, word has it that Mort Crim plays pool here.
Is that true? He wouldn't happen to be here  now, would he?  [BILLIARD BALLS SCATTER.]
[BOB SEGER'S "HOLLYWOOD NIGHTS".]
In those Hollywood hills   In those Hollywood hills   She was looking so right   In her diamonds and frills   Oh those big city nights   Better luck next time, Laredo.
Class dismissed.
Yeah, Rachel, another double ginger ale  with a splash of cranberry juice.
Hi, Mr.
Crim.
I'm Sam Duvet.
I know who you are.
We're friends on Facebook.
Whoa, you you memorized all your Facebook friends?  Well, I wouldn't be a very good friend if I didn't.
- Yeah.
- Well well ha.
Since we're friends, I don't mind telling you  I never miss a "Chump of the Week.
"  They ever considered going "Chump of the Day"?  Well, the suits would like me to do it every hour,  but, you know, what makes it special  is the fact that it's once a week.
It's anticipation.
It's like flirting is sometimes more fun than sex.
Yeah.
I like the sex, though.
I like soup, too, son,  but I just enjoy heating it up first.
- Oh.
- [LAUGHING.]
BOTH: Ho, ho!  - Man.
- Yes.
Mort, can we buy you a drink?  Yeah, you sure can.
And food too.
- Yeah - Yeah, by all means.
- Yeah, we can also order food.
- We'll all just  - Yeah.
- Yeah, we'll just have  a big ol' supper, all of us.
[MOTOWN MUSIC.]
Oh yeah   Oh yeah   So I swear to God, I say to Marvin Gaye,  "What's going on?"  And it's like a lightning bolt hit,  and he says, "Mort",  you know I already did an album with that name.
"  [BOTH LAUGH.]
Oh, Mort, I hope it's not crossing a line,  but we run a small ad firm  and we'd love for you to come and be the spokesperson  for Garner Weich Furniture.
We know it's just a local commercial,  but when we think of a name that people trust,  only one comes to mind.
A man who taught us about the world.
The man who picks us up on our worst days  and cheers us on in our best.
The man we rely on.
Mort Crim.
So, what's the commercial about?  Oh, it's it's great.
You point to a pull-out couch and you say,  "Come on down to Garner Weich Furniture,  where we don't sleep on savings.
"  No, no, no, no.
I mean, what's the big idea?  Why why do this commercial now?  - Uh yeah.
- Sell sell furniture.
No, no, no.
I mean, the commercial's got to  speak to what people really care about.
Now, what do you do on a sofa?  You watch TV, you read to the kids,  you pay some bills.
But it's a place where you think about the things  that really matter to you: the economy, health insurance,  ISIS, North Korea.
It's not a sofa.
It's Plymouth Rock.
You want to sell furniture, you go get Guy Gordon.
You want Mort Crim, you better be ready to get real.
Well, sir, we're ready to get real.
- Yes.
- All right, now,  let's get down to brass tacks.
Who shit in his pants?  - It's Tim's jacket.
- Shut up.
It stinks.
Should we say "sturdy" or "dependable"?  Like, which one sounds more like Mort?  I think he would say "sturdy" and "dependable.
"  "Sturdy and dependable.
" That's perfect.
That sounds just like Mort.
Father in the picture?  - Good, good.
- Hey, Mort.
Hey, guys, this script is fantastic.
Oh.
Right here,  where it says "sturdy," you mind if I say  "sturdy and dependable"?  Ha.
Go right ahead, Mort.
I mean, you really captured my voice.
It's like I wrote it myself.
Might want to do a few changes on the fly.
- Oh, no problem, absolutely.
- Mm-hmm.
We are all set.
Are you ready, Mr.
Crim?  Well, no, but that's never stopped me.
- [CHUCKLES.]
- [LAUGHS.]
Come on.
- Lay off the gas, man.
- Shut up, Tim.
Mort cares.
Here we go.
And action.
Hi, I'm Mort Crim.
I'd like to talk to you about Garner Weich Furniture.
It's sturdy and dependable  and oh, so fluffy.
We here at Garner Weich understand the importance  of comfort in an uncomfortable world.
The economy in shambles.
Unemployment at an all-time high.
And the chilling reality  that we're living every moment  in the bloodthirsty crosshairs of ISIS.
- What? - Folks, I won't sugarcoat it.
ISIS won't stop until every last one of us  is pink mist in the wind.
Cut.
That's not in the script.
Yeah, we'll get him back on track.
Yeah, no worries.
That felt good.
Yeah, it was great.
Absolutely perfect.
The one note is,  maybe on this one, don't do the ISIS stuff.
I'm giving you gold.
Don't make me shovel crap.
- Yep.
- Yeah, we we won't.
Did you tell him?  Yeah, we gave him the note.
So, he's going to stick to the script?  He's gonna talk about ISIS.
And action.
ISIS, let's settle this thing once and for all.
You choose your best man, send him here to Garner Weich  to fight me, Mort Crim.
Winner take all.
You win, America's yours.
I win, you give democracy a good old college try.
Plus, there's a cash prize.
25,000 to the winner.
25K, take home, tax-free,  put up by my good friends at Garner Weich.
Cut.
Print that one.
[UPBEAT MOTOWN MUSIC.]
Whoa, whoa, sir Ah, ah, ah.
My man, get your big ass over there and sign in.
Before I get up there and pop your head like a pimple.
- Pop.
- You can't touch me.
You can only say "sir" three times.
[LAUGHS.]
New day, fat ass.
New Ned, too.
New balls on this new Ned are bigger, stronger.
I'm geared up.

All right, well, why don't you just close the door  properly when you leave?  It's not about the door, Sam!  [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY.]
- What's up? - [SIGHS.]
Wanda was going crazy on me,  talking about firing me,  sending me back to Chuck E.

Well, then, just take 'em off  your big, Frankenstein-ass head.
Okay, Ned.
I'll take off the sunglasses.
I know you will.
Because I am not going back to Chuck E.
Cheese.
People always ask how Garner Weich Furniture  keeps its prices so low.
Oh, I hope Mort's okay with the edits we had to make.
He'll be fine.
He's a pro.
He knows, at the end of the day  it's all about pleasing the client  What's our secret?  Detroit newscasting legend Mort Crim.

You received many boxes of diarrhea  this morning in the mail.
Ugh, boxes of diarrhea?  I used to be the one sending diarrhea  to "Chumps of the Week.

You think I enjoy working next to you every day?  You're like a chimney with titties!  Yeah, old baggy ones too!  You better look out, Tommy Hearns will come by  and bounce those things around like  [IMITATES SPEEDBAG.]
Yeah, Lois, you're no prize yourself.
You're pretty old, you smoke, you eat like crap,  - Frickin' disgusting.
- Tim!  How is that different from what you guys were doing?  It can't be like real, Tim.
I see you still don't have kids.
You still shooting blanks, Tim?  Heck no, I'm packed full of sperm.
They're huge too.
I can feel them inside me right now.
Sometimes they hurt when they blast out.
Tim, come on.
I'm joking.
I don't know how to do it, I guess.
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried   Hope he feels better   And thanks, Jonetta from Cleveland   Hey.
Can we have one of those?  Oh, by all means.
Ladies, be my guest.
"Be my guest.
" You proper!  - Excuse me? - You talk proper.
What do you even mean?  The way you talk is proper.
Proper? Shoot, girl.
Far from it.
- Oh, okay.
- Is this your house?  Yeah, this the crib right here.
This is my homegirl Jasmin, but she got a boyfriend.
I'm Angel, though.
Oh, for real oh, word?  Word.
I'm Sam.
[FIREWORKS EXPLODING.]
Oooh!  I mean, that's it? Shoot.
I mean that last one, though, was spectacular.
Sam! Did you see that last one?  - Whoa! - [MOUTHING.]
Yo, patriotic as a muh.
Happy Fourth of July, everybody!  Happy Fourth, Lois.
I love you, you little bony bitch!  [SOFT ORGAN MUSIC.]
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.
- How you doing? - I'm holding up.
Hang in there, dum-dum.
Love you.
Guys, this is Elwood.
He was Lois' husband.
Oh, we're so sorry for your loss.
We loved Lois very much.
Damn emphysema.
If only I told her not  to smoke that last cigarette.
I don't think it was the last cigarette that did it.
[WHISPERED.]
Plus she ate like shit.
Tim!  Let us know if you ever need anything.
Someone to hang out with or just someone to talk to.
Tomorrow.
Huh?  Well, let's hang out tomorrow.
Okay.
Yeah, that'll be nice.
- Oh! - Oh, no!  What in the world?  Move on! This was her final wish.
We respected it.
Now just move on!  So waxy.
- She looks lovely.
- Thank you.
BOTH: Whoa!  Next time when they ask you where you're from   You gonna say Detroit City   Where we get you back on your feet   Yeah    Good afternoon.
Lois Warfield was a dedicated friend,  a loving wife, and a proud union autoworker.
And while we mourn her loss, let's look at the bright side.
God's car's gonna be running a little smoother tonight.
[LAUGHTER.]
And trust me, you know the big man  won't be driving an import.
Amen.
[LAUGHTER.]
It's not funny.
They're just laughing 'cause he's a pastor.
I know, he's capitalizing on these people's sorrow.
It's bull[BLEEP.]
.
Some of Lois' friends and family have asked  to say a few words.
Looking in the crowd at the faces of all my coworkers,  I'm gonna miss all the shit that Lois said about you  every single day.
[LAUGHTER.]
I mean, Fred, with Lois gone, who I'm gonna laugh with  about your double chins?  Double chins?  That's muscle, playa.
A lot of people thought Lois was mean,  but I knew with every jab,  every insult,  it was just her way of saying  "I love you.
"  I don't know what I'm gonna do without Lois.
Who's gonna make my sandwich?  Who's gonna make my bed?  Mm? That's it?  - Okay, then.
- That's all he's gonna say.
And we gotta hang out with this guy tomorrow.
- Well, you do.
- Thank you, brother Elwood.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
It was a lovely service.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm sorry again for your loss.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Yeah, I just want to say it was a beautiful service,  but you and I both know you wouldn't have gotten  those laughs if you weren't a pastor.
[SCOFFS.]
I'm sorry?  Oh, it's no big deal.
I don't care.
I'm just saying you're not actually funny,  so don't feel proud about today.
People grieve in their own ways, son.
- No.
No.
- I just wanted to say, beautiful service.
Oh, thank you.
I hope you don't think you deserved any of those laughs  - No, I just told him.
I just told him.
- Oh, okay.
I just gave him the heads up.
Okay, yeah, that's the worst kind of hack there is.
- Beautiful service, though! - Beautiful!  - Thank you again, gentlemen.
- My condolences.
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, yeah, sure.
Can't wait for tomorrow, Tim.
Yeah, me neither.
I'll be by then.
And you'll stay a while?  Yes.
Ugh.
You invited Angel to a funeral?  Nah, she's just picking me up.
I wanted her to see me in this suit.
I mean, you do look good in that suit.
Oh, and some buffs!  Oh!  You're ready? I'm sorry about your friend.
No, no, it's cool, it's cool.
I mean, she flown.
But I tell you what, baby, why don't you go grab the whip.
Uh I gotta holla at my my baby right here  about some business real quick.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Shut up, Tim.
- All right, then.
- All right? - You're gonna get busted.
I'm not gonna get busted.
I can keep this up.
- Sam! - Huh?  - You comin'? - Shoot, baby,  I ain't said nothing but a mother[BLEEP.]
word.
See ya, Sam.
Yeah, baby.
No, oh, word? Shoot!  [LAUGHS.]
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, no.
It ain't nothing but a thing.
All right.
Yeah, I'll run through then.
All right, peace.
That was Angel.
Yeah, I know, because of how you talked.
Did it sound natural?  No, you're gonna get busted.
Shoot, I'm gonna be just fine,  pl-pl-pep boy.
- Pep boy? - Oh, no.
Uh-oh!  See you later.
I'm going to work.
Okay.
You're gonna be all right?  It's gonna be tough working with someone new.
Yeah, I know, but I'm gonna go in with an open mind.
- Mm-hmm.
- She won't be Lois,  but no one is.
Ah, but, Chrissy, think of how hard  it's gonna be on your new linemate when she finds out  Never mind.
What?  It was just a perfectly-worded slam  that would've totally devastated you,  but you're grieving, so  - Thank you, Sam.
- Thank you, Sam.
- You're welcome.
- So nice of you.
- Bye.
I love you.
- Love you too.
[DOORBELL RINGS.]
- Hey, I'm here.
- Come on in,  I'll show you around the house.
Okay.
Sure.
This used to be our room.
Pictures.
Lamp.
That used to be our bed.
Sorry it's a mess, but Lois used to make the bed.
Now,  she's gone.
Hey, I can make the bed for you, Elwood.
You'd do that for me?  Yeah, I'd be happy to.
Yes.
Wow, look at you.
You're a pro at that.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Thank you.
This is the kitchen.
Lois used to make sandwiches for me  in here when she was alive.
Now she's sandwiches for worms.
I sure am hungry.
I can make you a sandwich, Elwood.
Well, you were so good at making that bed.
[LAUGHTER.]
Shut up.
You're a good man, Tim.
Yeah, well, everybody loved Lois,  so it's no problem at all.
What's the ETA on that sandwich?  - It's coming.
- Like five?  - Ten? - Probably ten.
Five would be better.
Okay, yeah.
I'll see what I can do.
Everybody loved Lois very much.
You came into my life   Oh, baby, how about "Star Century Prime"?  You know? I heard it just came out today,  it looks good as mud.
No, let's just go see "Fat Bieber.
"  Yeah, it does look hilarious.
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.
But you know, I heard "Star Century Prime"  is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I mean that's consensus.
Well, you know, Jasmin saw "Fat Bieber" yesterday,  - and she said it was real funny.
- Jasmin said that, huh?  Yeah, well, I guess she knows more than Leonard Maltin.
- Leonard Maltin! - [LAUGHTER.]
No, you know what? Let's go to "Fat Bieber" then.
Shoot, we might mess around and see two movies.
- You play too much.
- No.
Whoa, baby, whoa, baby I'm coming home   -  Baby, whoa, baby  - Yo, Chrissy!  Bring it in, bring it in.
Chrissy, this is Margaret, your new linemate.
Margaret, this is Chrissy.
She gonna be showing you the ropes, all right? All right.
- Hey, Margaret.
- Chrissy, nice to meet you.
You check out Fred and his double chins?  His neck lookin' like a sideways butt.
He was very nice to me.
Yeah, sure, sorry.
My old linemate and I used to make fun of people.
Just our way of showing love.
Well, I was bullied as a kid,  so that sort of thing isn't fun for me.
- Oh, sorry.
- Kids can be so mean.
Kids made fun of me because my head was always in a book.
My hairline started at my eyebrows.
[SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER.]
That must've been very hard for you.
It was.
So you were like Moe from "The Three Stooges?"  Shit!  Okay.
Back door's locked and I checked the crawlspace.
Nobody in there.
Well, Elwood, I've had a great entire Sunday with you.
Do you mind staying until I fall asleep? Lois used to.
Yeah, but she used to live here.
And she died here.
[SIGHS.]
I don't know how I'm ever gonna get to sleep  without the smell of smoke in here.
- I'm not smoking, Elwood.
- I don't smoke.
Nighty night.
Oh, no! Yo, I grew up and got fat, yo!  [LAUGHTER.]
I'm gonna have to go back in Usher's time machine  and warn myself not to smoke weed!  Mm-hmm! Don't you do it, Justin!  - You smoke that kush! - [LAUGHTER.]
Babe, I'm trying to listen, okay?  If we're gonna talk, we're gonna talk,  but if we're gonna watch the movie, let's just watch the movie.
Okay, here I go! Come on, Sammich.
Man, that [BLEEP.]
fat!  [LAUGHTER.]
Let's maybe leave the jokes to the professionals.
Man, turn your ass around!  [DRAMATIC CINEMATIC MUSIC.]
I will have you ejected, just so you know.
[LAUGHTER.]
He wild!  - Yeah.
- Wild! Wild!  Look at how fat he is.
[LAUGHTER.]
- That big ol' fat negro.
- [LAUGHTER.]
Oh! Oh, my God!  Oh! This is amazing!  What?  Uh, we smashing, you know what I mean?  - Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
[BOTH MOANING.]
Oh, yeah! Talk more to me, daddy!  Nah, dawg.
Boom, boom, boom, boom! I'm putting in work!  - I'm all up in them guts.
- Oh, no!  - Whoa! Jesus! - I'm sorry.
Sam, if Dad heard you talking like that,  he would beat your ass.
[SCOFFS.]
I would knock Dad out.
I mean, don't tell Dad.
Sam, I don't know why you're acting  like somebody you're not,  just to impress some hoochie mama.
Chrissy! "Hoochie mama"?  Shame on you for judging people,  when you yourself are the biggest piece of shit  I've ever seen.
Sam, her linemate just died.
Ah, a week ago.
Gloves are off.
She's got a new linemate.
Who cares?  But I can't say anything to Margaret or she'll cry.
What do you mean?  She was bullied as a kid, so I can't say shit about her  or anybody else.
The other day, Fred farted so hard his back went out.
[LAUGHTER.]
She didn't even giggle!  She said, "It's not funny! He's actually hurt!"  [LAUGHTER.]
I'm sorry, babe.
That sucks.
He's getting workman's comp.
[LAUGHTER.]
- See? It's funny! - Yes!  Lunchtime.
Mm-mm-mm! Look at that hamper.
You know, Lois used to do the laundry.
Yeah, yeah, she did everything around here.
And you know what?  I am not Lois!  Elwood, it's time for you to start making your own damn bed!  It's time for you to start making  your own damn sandwiches.
It's not hard! Just put two pieces of bread  around slices of meat!  - Is this it? - No, that's a ball!  Come on, I feel like you're getting it wrong on purpose.
No, I'm not! I can't do it.
Well, then you're gonna have to figure this shit out, man.
One day, I'll die and Chrissy will have to figure out  how to go on without me!  - Maybe she could remarry.
- No!  If your spouse dies and you remarry, you go to Hell, man!  Sorry.
Come here.
Good-bye, Elwood.
You can do this.
[FUNKY, UPBEAT MUSIC.]
Margaret, I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.
But I can't work in silence every day.
I have to talk, or I'll go crazy.
You want to make fun of people.
I don't like bullies.
I know.
It's because my hairline used to start at my eyebrows.
Oh, I know, and it sucks that happened to you.
They used to say the meanest things to me.
They used to call me "Bride of Chewbacca.
"  Maybe you should tell me what else they would call you.
You know, to get it off of your chest.
They used to call me the Forehead-less Horseman.
Assholes!  'Sup, ladies?  What do you think those jerks would've said  about Little Joey?  Oh, man, they'd probably say something like,  "Little Joey's so short,  he needs a ladder to go down on Tinkerbell.
"  You know, like he'd have to climb up that ladder  to [BLEEP.]
out her vagina or something like that.
That is so mean.
What do you think they'd say about Fred?  They'd say, "Fred's neck is so weak,  he has to ask his tits for lunch money.
"  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.]
What up, y'all?  This my man, Sam.
Ha.
'Sup, 'sup, 'sup?  Ooh, y'all y'all drinkin', huh?  Uh, let me get a Hpno.
[LAUGHTER.]
You know what I'm saying?  Yo, Sam, your pants tight as hell, my [BLEEP.]
Yeah, that's funny you mentioned that,  'cause this is the only pants I had that was, uh clean.
I went I bought some I thought I was getting these  in a XXL, and I got home, these are medium.
I was like, I gotta go to the store  and talk to these people face to face.
So I went to the store, I was like, "Hey!"  Hey, my brah, uh You gave me the wrong size pants.
"  And it was like, "Nothing I can do for you, man.
"  I was like, "Really, bro?" [LAUGHS.]
And then, so I was like, "Let me talk to your manager.
"  And then the manager came out, and it's like,  "Nothing I can do for you.
We have no refund policy.
"  So, I was like, "You about to come up  with a refund for me, .
"  You ever notice how some folks say the word [BLEEP.]
,  it just doesn't sound right?  - Leave him alone, Ray.
- Okay?  'Cause he may talk white, but he's still cute.
Actually, I'm sexy,  but I don't even really talk white, baby.
- I don't even know - Sam.
Listen to your voicemail.
Yello, you've reached Sam Duvet.
You know what to do, and that is leave a message.
[LAUGHTER.]
"Yello, you've reached Frasier.
Leave a message.
"  [LAUGHTER.]
All right! You got me!  I talk "proper"!  I can't even see with these on.
So, okay.
So what?  So because I talk proper that means I talk white?  And then thus, to speak improperly  means you speak black? Are we okay with this?  Are we okay with this as a people? Hmm?  [LAUGHTER.]
You know what's cool? [LAUGHTER.]
Being your ding-dong self.
How 'bout that?  Unless you are being yourselves,  which I you probably are,  I don't know! I don't care! I guess my point is  Is just have a good time! Cheers!  Oh, heavens, is there pineapple in this Hpnotiq?  I'm allergic to pineapple!  - [LAUGHTER.]
- It's not funny!  It's a legitimate allergy!  I need an antihistamine or an EpiPen!  Once I got her talking, Margaret never stopped.
Today was actually a pretty fun day.
Chrissy, you just tricked her into being mean.
You're a bad person.
Go eat pineapples, you fat head.
Shut up.
Hey, this is Sam.
Leave a message.
Why do we still have to do this?  I thought Angel dumped you.
You've reached Sam Duvet.
Leave your thing at the bizzay!  - Just use your regular voice.
- I'm trying!  Hey, you've reached Slammin' Sammy Duvet!  I'm not here right now, because I'm out rocking the jocks!  - There it is.
- There you go.
Thank you.
- That's all I ask.

- That one felt right.
- Use your regular voice.
- That was it.
- That's normal me.

I've lost so much weight,  I need a whole new wardrobe.
Medicinal Weight Loss   I founded Medicinal Weight Loss to help people  achieve their dream bodies.
I guess some dreams can come true.
Medicinal Weight Loss, the shape of you is new   Dr.
Mayflower made another ad  without us?    Who the hell made it for him?  Doner made it, brah-brah.
Doner? You left us for Doner?  This Lepchek guy said he can  increase my business by 15%.
Un-freaking-believable.
Said a guy like me should own a boat.
I don't have a boat.
I want a boat.
I told you you could borrow our pontoon boat  anytime you want, just not during Jobbie Nooner.
But that's when I'ma need it.
It's a boat party.
For less money,  Lepchek did my commercial good.
Oh, our commercial was good.
Yeah, the guy said his kid didn't recognize him anymore,  and daddy wasn't funny since he lost the weight.
I mean, for the record,  we didn't ask him to say any of that.
But you still put it in the commercial.
Yeah, 'cause if we didn't put that in,  we wouldn't have had enough stuff.
Guys, the new commercial's great,  it's bringing in business,  and it actually lists my correct phone number  on the screen.

You can go ahead and just spray paint it on his desk  and trash his entire office, please.
Dani, that won't be necessary.
- I wasn't gonna do it anyway.
- Hmm.
Ryan Lepchek, you tall, fat drink of crap.
You stole our client, man.
Can you be more specific?  Dr.
Mayflower, oh, my God.
- You have General Mills.
- Mm-hmm.
You have Chrysler.
They're great.
Don't come to our toilet,  reach in, and pull out our shit!  Dr.
Mayflower was our shit.
Guys, this is how advertising works.
We steal each other's clients.
Okay, uh, it's like this.
Guy steals second base, right? He's not cheating.
He's just trying to win the game.
Well, statistically speaking,  it's stupid to try and steal second base.
- I mean, moneyball.
- It's basic moneyball.
Okay, look, if it makes you feel any better,  it's nothing personal, okay?  We offered them a discount because  we needed some bottom-of-the-barrel clients  for our summer interns to train on, okay?  That does not make me feel any better, okay?  Look, our clients are our family.
Thank you for coming in, Mr.

Excuse me, ma'am?  You look like you're looking for  two of the best admen in town.
Yeah, uh, we represent a small firm  that's not so small in talent rude.

Hey, what's up, dudes?  Hey, you heading into Doner?  - Ah, yes, we are.
- Ah, too bad.
- Excuse me? - Oh, it's just I heard you can get  better service and a lower price  at a place called Cramblin Duvet.
Cramblin Duvet.
Thanks for the tip, but I think we're good.
Ah, Doner sucks, sir.
Uh, seems like you suck.
- Do I suck? - No, man, no.
It's just, he came up with it so fast.
Like, it was so quick.
You don't suck at all.
Thanks, bud.
- Get out of here! - Hey!  Why did you kick me out? I'm a client of Doner.
We hate our clients here at Doner!  You bring your ass back around here,  I'ma whup your ass for no reason.
Hey, you shouldn't have to be treated like that.
Yeah, we run Cramblin Duvet,  and we always treat our clients with respect  and never have our security guard  kick them out for no reason.
Well, you don't know what he did.
Doesn't matter what he did.
What'd he do?  Uh, I think the point is that he  Wasn't doing anything,  and he kicked him out  for no reason because the company is bad.
No reason?  The man cut his dick off in the break room!  Too far.
- Too far, Ned.
- Ned, that is unbelievable.
People, there's a microwave in there that people eat  Be careful, there's dick blood everywhere.
W-watch your feet, you got on dress shoes.
Have a good day.

C-come closer.
I think these might be his last words, maybe.

On a scale of one to ten,  how happy are you with the service at Doner?  What?  I think he said, on a scale of one to ten,  how happy are you with your service over at Doner?  I don't get any service, I work there.
Work there? God damn it.
What kind of scam is this?  I wasted, like, ten blood capsules on you.
I keep on swallowing them.
Don't waste people's time, sir.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Don't just eat the blood capsules.
Are you just swallowing 'em?  - Yeah.
- I use these all the time.
Mr.
Hark, you have designed some of  the greatest American cars in the last 20 years.
So you creating your own car company  is massive news, and we here at Doner  Mr.
Lepchek?  Yes, Dani?  I am so sorry,  but those men are still here.
[SIGHS.]
It's a couple of low-level ad guys  trying to steal our clients.
Um, it's fine as long as they're not harassing anyone.
They're saying this is Boner Advertising  and they're not looking for clients.
- Boom! - Shit.
Mr.
Hark.
This place is boner.
Sir? Mr.
Hark?  - So close to boner! - Hello, Boner?  [BOTH CACKLING.]
All right, next time, let's just not wait for them to respond.
Let's just shove them in the car.
Yeah, maybe we say we work for free, 'cause, I mean,  - it's not about the money.
- No.
It's about stealing them from Doner.
Yeah, once they're in the car, we can tell them  - anything we want.
- Yeah.
Drive.
Holy shit, you're Allen Hark.
I hear you're looking to steal one of Doner's clients.
Well, you heard right.
Then drive.
[TYRONE CHESTNUT'S "THE BUMP" PLAYING.]
Come on   This is where my father worked his whole life.
Ah.
The world our children will grow up in  is vastly different from the world we live in now.
I don't have any children.
Yeah, I'm not even seriously dating anyone right now.
It's not that I'm a player, it's just, I like the idea of a first kiss.
- Yeah, he loves kisses.
- Well, I don't have any children either.
I was just talking about the next generation.
- Yes.
- Ah, cool, cool, cool, cool.
- Other people's kids.
- Yeah.
I've raised over $200 million in investor money  to start my own company, one that values creativity over conformity.
I went to Doner today.
That kid, Lepchek?  Gave me the best presentation I've ever seen.
But I don't want to bring a boxer to a knife fight.
I want the kind of guys that'll bring a gun  to a kid's birthday party.
- That's us.
- A toy gun, I guess.
- Yeah, but we'd do it.
- We would, for sure.
I can make the best car in the world,  but it won't matter if no one wants to buy it.
- We're your guys.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you? - Yeah.
Sell me this pencil.
Excuse me?  Sell me the pencil.
- Uh the okay.
- Uh  Uh, no problem, no problem at all.
Yeah, here it comes.
[BOTH STAMMERING.]
Life goes by so fast, and each day you see  - Sell me the pencil.
- I Yep, yep.
Well, first let's get you a water or something.
- You thirsty? - The pencil!  Welcome to this our store.
We've been in business for a little while.
Little while.
We're struggling.
Okay, I'll sell you my car.
No, no, sell me the pencil.
600 bucks, that's what I'm saying,  lease to own, 30 bucks a month,  I pay your car insurance.
That's a terrible deal for you.
Is that yes? Is that a yes?  You know what?  This isn't a pencil.
No  this is a, uh,  trumpet.
[IMITATING TRUMPET.]
Jazz.
Holy  Whatever, I already own the pencil.
Well, yeah, exactly.
How are we gonna sell it to you if you already own it?  The whole pencil thing was fun but a little stupid.
- Yeah, it was fun, though.
- It was dumb.
- It was dumb.
- But it taught me something.
You guys are hungry,  and that's a good thing, because, gentlemen,  I've made the car of the future.
Whoa.
And you are going to help me sell it.
Is he walking?  - Sir, you probably shouldn't walk here.
- Is he walking?  Tim, I think we just sold Hark Motors.
[BOTH LAUGH.]
Hey, Susan, quick question.
Is it too late for me to buy  Girl Scout cookies from your daughter?  Lepchek!  You old barrel of dog piss and dog shit.
- Hey.
- Guess who we just landed?  Hark Motors.
Stole him from right under your nose.
[BOTH SNICKER.]
I mean, no offense, but how did you guys land Hark Motors?  - We're smart.
- We gonna bury you guys, steal all your  Mm.
Cash for Copper Carl,  what are you doing here?  Tim and Sam.
I'm just simply listening  to what these business people have to say.
Yeah, but you're our client.
Be that as it may,  they say they can help me with my auto shop  that replaces car windows and car radios  should somebody have smashed your car window  and taken your car radio.
Smart.
- Just a nice business idea.
- Good idea.
- Helpful for people.
- Frickin' good idea.
- Gentlemen.
- See ya.
Yeah.
You really are a piece of giant horse crap.
I don't know what type of rivalry you think we have,  but honestly, I just want the best for you guys.
And we want to kill you.
D-E-A-D.
Frickin  [BOTH MOUTHING WORDS.]
Offensive.
I don't come into your office  and flip off that nice old lady that sits in that front desk.
- She's not nice.
- She's not nice.
She is old.
- She's not nice.
- Bips.
[FUNKY MUSIC.]
Welcome, welcome.
Goodness!  Here, this is for you.
[CHUCKLES.]
"Zug Island Dog Dick Cabernet.
"  Yeah.
It had the funniest name of all the ones in the store.
That's very funny, thank you.
Did you see the ad we placed in the paper?    I see.
Now you've publicly entwined our destinies.
Very good.
Well, I hope you won't think I'm an old fuddy-duddy  for asking you to remove your shoes in the house.
Oh, no, not at all.
Oh no, my grandma does the same thing.
And put on these shoes.
Okay.
Right now?  This is the south staircase.
It's the down one.
We use the north staircase to go up.
Uh, um, can you go up on this one?  [DING.]
Hello, Allen.
Whoa, cool.
Smart homes have been done.
I wanted my home to be completely intuitive.
It knows what I want before I know myself.
Good night, Allen.
[DING.]
Lights on.
Hello, Allen.
I guess I must be tired.
Or maybe I am.
No.
It only responds to me.
No, I no, I know, I was just joking.
So, uh, Allen,  when are we gonna get a look at this new car?  We'd love to come up with a marketing strategy,  take it for a test drive.
Patience, Tim.
All will be revealed after dinner.
Not to malign what you do,  but this car is going to sell itself.
Well, that should make our job pretty easy.
I'll still expect you to do your best work.
No, I know, I was just joking again.
Just chill out, lay off the gas.
- I know, I'm just trying - Whoa.
Oh.
[WHIRRING.]
Thank you.
Beautiful, isn't she?  Hmm?  It's okay, we're all men.
There's no need to be shy here.
Do you find her very beautiful?  I mean, if you do.
Let me ask you something, gentlemen.
Would you believe she is, in fact,  a robot?  - Yes.
- Yes, I would.
Well, that's because I told you.
No, 'cause  Had I not used the word "robot,"  you wouldn't have suspected.
It's very, very obvious.
Most men would kill for a wife like that.
Is that your wife?  The face of a Mona Lisa.
Brains too.
Brains of Mona Lisa?  Shall we eat?  It appears my house believes  that I wanted spaghetti tonight,  and I'm confident that deep down, I do.
I guess deep down you didn't want any meatballs either.
Good night, Allen.
- Hmm.
- There it goes.
Lights on.
-  - Hello, Allen.
Guess I must be tired.
Sam, you'll be interested in this.
It's the ceremony where I became an honorary black man.
That's why I'm allowed to say the N word.
No.
Right this way, gentlemen.
He's nuts.
This car's gonna be made out of cardboard.
He's not allowed to say the N word.
[EXCITING MUSIC.]
Gentlemen, introducing the world's first  zero emissions car.
Whoa.
Zero emissions?  That's right.
I've engineered it so that this car takes  all of its harmful carbon emissions and exhausts  and expels it  into a non-toxic blob.
Listen to that engine purr.
That looks like shit.
Well, no.
It's emissions.
The car shoots out an emissions blob.
So, it shits?  I don't think you understand the significance  of what I've done here.
You've invented a shitting car.
It's not shit.
It's a blob.
Uh, can you make it any other color?  No, I've tried.
Well, it smells like shit.
No, it doesn't.
Then what does it smell like?  Mm-hmm.
Uh, all right, look, you've got plenty of money.
We can fix this.
The money's gone.
You spent $200 million on a shitting car  and a robot with boobs?  Once people start buying the car,  there'll be no end of money.
We can do this thing together.
Okay, how much do you think  people are gonna pay for a crapping car?  I was hoping $1.
5 million.
Each?  Yeah, the car costs $1.
4 million to make.
This is very disappointing.
I should never have trusted Lepchek about you.
Lepchek told you to hire us?  That asshole!  Well, good-bye, Allen.
Thanks for the spaghetti.
Good luck to you and yours.
Give me $1,000 and I'll let you sleep with my wife.
What?  Aww, come on.
I see the way you've been looking at her.
[SCOFFS.]
I mean, maybe we don't have to tell anybody  that he's insane and broke.
Yeah, I mean, maybe people  would want a car that shits for $1 million.
Yeah, maybe.
[LAUGHS.]
What a psycho.
Oh, I know!  - Freaking psycho! - Right? He's nuts.
Jesus.
What did that idiot say he wanted to sleep with his wife?  - Oh.
- 1,000 bucks?  - Nuts.
- Yeah.
He'd probably let me do it for, like, $500.
- Sam.
- I'm not gonna.
You piece of crap!  I'm sorry, Mr.
Lepchek, I tried to stop them.
You barely tried.
I don't want to kick your ass.
Whatever.
How can I help you guys?  You told Allen Hark to hire us to sell  his pooping car to make us laughingstocks.
What? No.
I said you were psychos.
You son of a bitch!  That's exactly what he wanted to hear!  Guys, that honestly wasn't my intention, all right?  Call it even?  No, it's not even.
You stole from us.
Now we  are going to steal from you.
Yeah, something from this office.
Yeah.
Okay, what are you gonna steal?  I'm gonna steal your laptop.
- Not the laptop.
- Oh, no,  I'm not stealing that.
It's expensive.
I'll get in huge trouble.
You know what, I'm taking this  dragon skeleton thing.
That's an actual Maniraptoran dinosaur fossil.
Oh, sweet.
Aw, God damn it, that's cool.
- Thanks.
- What about this thing?  It's dumb, who cares.
Ooh.
Well, I guess you picked your item.
No! I don't want that.
It's broken!  God damn it, Sam, we could've had that dino!  I know.
Best of luck to you guys.
Eat a butt, Lepchek!  [LAUGHING.]
[FUNKY MUSIC.]
I honestly like those guys.
What?  Nothing, Tim.
My mama got it, mama got it   My papa got it   Hey, it's the suck twins.
How's the sucking business?  You're the one who sucks.
Ohh, shit!  My dude!  My dude!  - Burn, asshole! - In your face.
- That's John Kerry.
- That is John Kerry.
I think that is

- ALL: Fowling! - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS.]
[PINS CLATTER.]
[UPBEAT MUSIC.]
Hey, how are ya?  We're here for the charity event.
The entry is a suggested $100 donation.
And I would suggest a much lower number.
- [BOTH LAUGH.]
- Is there an open bar?  - Yes.
- Oh! [BLOWS RASPBERRY.]
You're gonna lose money on this deal.
- It's dumb, stupid.
- This is dumb.
- You guys are suckers.
- Idiots.
- Here you go, sucker.
- Thank you.
Oh, there's Harbaugh.
- [SCATTERED GROANS.]
- Dang it!  It's okay, Jim.
We're just having fun, for charity.
Well, it's totally different mechanics.
Fowling is different.
You think LeBron James would be good at pop-a-shot?  - Look at this guy! - I'm getting this.
Dang it!  This guy's killing me!  - There she is.
- [HARBAUGH GRUNTS.]
Let's do it.
[UPBEAT FUNKY MUSIC.]
- Oh, yum-yum-yum.
- This looks delicious.
I can't wait to have another slice.
Uh, s-sorry, you each have a  A pepperoni on your face.
- Oh, God damn it.
- [GROANS.]
- Oh, crap.
- How embarrassing.
First we donate $10,000 to charity,  and now we got pepperoni on our faces.
- [SOFT LAUGH.]
- I'm sorry.
You probably get this all the time,  but has anybody ever told you you look just like  Emma Stone.
[TSKS.]
No.
I was thinking Reilly Clair, VP of Marketing, Little Caesars.
Oh, actually, yeah, I am Reilly Clair.
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.
.
- [BOTH LAUGH.]
- Are you serious?  That's I mean So embarrassing.
Oh, my God.
- First, we donate 1OK.
- Each.
- Each.
- And now this? Ugh.
Sam Duvet.
Cramblin Duvet Advertising.
- Hi.
- Yeah.
How you doing?  Tim Cramblin, the aforementioned  Cramblin Duvet Advertising.
We would love to work with you someday.
Oh, well, actually we are looking for a new agency.
Oh, my God.
I had not heard that.
- Sam, had you heard that? - I had not heard that.
Oh, had I heard that I would have said,  "Well, look no further  You found the perfect guys for the job.
"  - Had I heard that.
- Had he heard that.
Dang it! Give me that.
Watch this.
[YELLS.]
I don't mind telling you,  we're the two best admen in the city.
But we're also big fans of your Little Caesar's pizza.
Oh, thank you.
The smell of one of your Hot-N-Readys instantly  takes us back to some of our greatest childhood memories.
And not just for us, but for everyone we know.
[WAILS.]
You couldn't walk 50 miles in any direction  from the spot we're standing in right now  without coming across a birthday party,  graduation, or an anniversary  that isn't serving a great, big, piping-hot  - I can't believe this! - Little Caesars  - [BALL THUNKS.]
- [WOMAN GASPS, MAN GROANS.]
Pizza, pizza.
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah    Welcome back to "Mitch, Please!"  With your host Mitch Albom and Ken B-B-B-Brown!  All right, we're back.
Take a look at what happened  at a local fowling charity event  where Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh  can't hit a single pin,  but does connect with the back of this guy's head.
- [BALL THUNKS.]
- [WOMAN GASPS, MAN GROANS.]
- Pizza, pizza.
- What a moron!  I don't know why, but I hate this guy.
I mean, I guess I see what's funny about that.
I guess, I mean, like,  but wouldn't it be funnier if I had gotten knocked out?  I mean, what's funny about not flinching?  I mean, we almost had Little Caesars!  I could tell, Reilly was into that pitch, man.
Had you not getting beaned to the back of the head  by Harbaugh's throw at that exact moment,  we'd have landed the Little Caesars account.
Yeah, and I wouldn't have been  hit in the head with a football.
[SOFTLY.]
Hey, how How is your head, man?  Don't.
Don't even.
I should have asked you that right after it happened.
- I apologize.
Sorry.
- Yeah, man.
[CELL PHONES CHIME.]
[FUNKY UPBEAT MUSIC.]
Guys, thank you so much for coming in on such  short notice, but we were really excited to talk to you.
- We're excited to be here.
- Yeah.
Is it true that the water fountains here  shoot out cheese and not water?  No.
How how would that work?  I'm not stupid.
Cool.
Oh, my God.
Those windows are always supposed to be closed!  That's where we come up with the new pizzas.
[CHUCKLES.]
I thought I saw a pizza ball in there.
No, you didn't.
You didn't see anything.
[SOFTLY.]
There was a real nice pizza ball.
- The guy spazzed.
- The guy spazzed.
You know they're up to something.
Oh, hey, guys, grab a slice of pizza and have a seat.
We'll get started in just a second.
Hi, Tim.
- How's it going? - Good.
Paul Sloan.
I used to work for your dad at Cramblin.
- I'm at Little Caesars now.
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Meet me? - Are you kidding?  It's me, Paul.
I remember when you used to fit in the palm of my hand.
Heck, kid, I used to change your diapers.
Why would you have changed my diapers?  'Cause they were filled with poop.
- No why you? - Listen  All right, guys, let's get started.
All right, everyone, this is Tim and Sam  from Cramblin Duvet Advertising.
No introduction is needed for me.
I used to change that guy's diapers.
[LAUGHTER.]
Shut up.
Well, needless to say,  these two made quite an impression yesterday.
I'm sorry, you guys want to tell it?  Uh, yeah, sure.
Uh, we ran into Reilly when we were eating  Little Caesars pizza, actually.
We had pepperonis on our faces.
We had pepperonis on our faces.
And we told her, you couldn't walk 50 miles in any direction  from the spot we're standing in right now  Yeah, guys, uh, just tell them the part where  Harbaugh pegged you in the back of the head with a football.
It was hilarious.
Was it?  And that's when we knew we needed to hire you two  to do an ad for us.
Hire us?  We just landed Little Caesars?  Congratulations.
- Oh, my God! - Holy hell.
Oh, well, I gotta tell you,  you're not gonna be disappointed.
- No, hell no.
- Promise you that.
We're gonna put together the best friggin' ad you've ever seen.
Yeah, or else we'll die trying.
Boom!  - Oh, no, my friend's dead! - [LAUGHS.]
No, uh, guys you already pitched the perfect commercial.
Even a football to the back of the head  won't stop you from enjoying Little Caesars  - [BALL THUNKS.]
- [WOMAN GASPS, MAN GROANS.]
- Pizza, pizza.
- [LAUGHTER.]
I mean, come on.
That is the commercial.
Am I right?  [FALSETTO.]
Ohh, yeah.
[FALSETTO, MUMBLING.]
Uh, that's pretty good.
[FALSETTO, MUMBLING.]
Pretty good.
Hey, Quintin! Two beers for two guys  who just landed Little Caesars Pizza.
- We just left the headquarters.
- Cool.
I heard the water fountains there  squirt out cheese instead of water.
Are you stupid?  Fellas.
I don't mean to interrupt, but, uh,  love your Harbaugh video, man.
Hey, it's my girl's birthday.
I wonder if she come over here, we could, like,  throw her purse at the back of your head.
You could be like, "Birthday, birthday"?  No, I'm okay.
Thanks, though.
Oh.
So you're an asshole.
Baby, he said no.
Asshole!  I'm not embarrassed by what happened,  but at the same time, I don't like the idea of  perpetuating the incident in a commercial for  the largest pizza brand on the planet.
It's just our foot in the door, Sam.
All we have to do now is pitch them a brand-new idea  that undeniably better than  you getting hit in the head with a football.
Yeah, anything's funnier than that.
How bout we take a  - [CAN THUNKS.]
- [LAUGHS.]
[LAUGHING.]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, man.
We're big fans.
[LAUGHING.]
Well, you can't beat funny with funny.
So the new idea has to be something that  shamelessly pulls at people's heartstrings.
Ooh! Okay, how about this?  Uh, an old lady's crying by a river.
Uh, uh, she's tossing her husband's ashes in the river.
And a a fish eat the ashes  and jumps out of the water  and winks at the old lady.
Uh, she catches the fish, puts it in a tank.
She has her husband back.
Little Caesars.
Oh, my God, it's perfect.
I just I don't know how you  grab a fish out of the water, is the only thing  Yeah, but making a fish wink is easy?  It's your idea, asshole!  [CAN THUNKS.]
You proud?  Enough!  - I'm thinking for the tag - Yeah.
We got with: "It's not just a slice of pizza.
"  - It's a little slice of home.
" - Oh, it's great.
It's so much better than "slice of house.
"  - Mm-hmm.
We got this.
- Yeah.
- Follow my lead.
- Yes.
Mmm, let me take a bite of this Little Caesars.
Pizza, pizza.
[LAUGHTER.]
Oh, my gosh, Donnie, that was terrific.
Thank you so much for coming in.
I'm gonna need the pizza, but thank you so much.
[CHUCKLING.]
He was great!  Oh, my God, I cannot believe his pants fell down  in the middle of the audition.
He looked like a complete idiot.
- He's perfect.
- Right?  Excuse me? Uh.
Are you guys auditioning actors already?  Yeah.
Reilly, can we talk to you for a second?  Sure.
There he is!  I've seen this guy naked from head to toe.
As a baby.
I used to change his diapers.
This kid would eat anything he got his hands on.
And then his face would scrunch up and turn red and bam!  It would should out the front, the back, and everywhere.
And I used to have to clean up every inch.
Where were my parents?  Why was I left alone with you?  [CHUCKLES.]
And don't get me started about the piss!  - [IMITATES WHIZZING.]
- [LAUGHS.]
We're just a little concerned  with how fast things are moving.
Yeah and we actually have a brand-new idea  that I think you're gonna like even more.
- I hope you have tissues ready.
- Mm-hmm.
Because imagine this.
An old lady stands by a river  Yeah, guys, I'm sorry, we're just  We're really happy with the guy getting hit  in the head with the football, so.
Hello, Reilly.
Oh, hey, Andrew.
I came straight from the airport.
I'd love to get the production meeting done,  so I can have a bath.
Oh, of course you would, you poor thing.
Okay, it's just right down there  - through the conference room.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
[SOFTLY.]
That's Andrew.
He's directing the commercial.
- Wait, what? - Wha  I thought we were directing?  - [LAUGHS.]
Oh.
Uh, no, God no.
Sorry, guys.
That was never an option.
We've directed hundreds of commercials.
Yeah, I I know.
We've seen them.
We once directed five commercials in one day.
Look, guys, Andrew is one of  the premiere advertisement directors in the world, okay?  Just sit back and let him do his thing.
And who knows?  You guys might even win a D Award for this.
Huh?  [CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS.]
[CHEERING AND LAUGHTER.]
Well, don't get mad at us!  Yeah, shut the blinds if you don't  want us to see your fancy pizza ball!  [MUFFLED.]
You didn't see a pizza ball!  Yes, we did!  [SMOOTH SMALTZY POP MUSIC.]
- Whoa.
- Look at this.
Hey, guys.
What the hell are you guys doing here?  We're here to support you on your big day.
- I took the day off of work.
- We all did.
Well, not you, Tommy.
Technically, this is still work for you.
- In fact, get me a coffee, man.
- Right away.
- Would you look at those! - Oh.
Sit in your chairs so I can take pictures of you in 'em.
Come on, Chrissy, that's embarrassing.
This is work for us, it's not like fun.
[SOFT SQUEAL.]
Got it.
[SQUEALING.]
Oh, look at you, so cute!  Actually, it's sexy, so.
- And action.
- We at Little Caesars  want to find out what it would take to stop you  from enjoying our pizza.
Introducing test item 423  - a football.
- Cut!  That's excellent, Brian.
Excellent? It wasn't very funny.
That wasn't funny at all.
I mean, should it be like Should he make a funnier face?  Or say, like, a funnier number?  Like, could he say "frickin' football"?  [LAUGHS.]
That's funny.
- [CHUCKLES.]
- Go tell him.
Oh, no, I can't They're doing their thing.
Yeah, we're not directing this one.
It's your commercial.
I'm sure they'd be interested in your ideas.
You guys make everything better.
We can probably fly in one note.
- We can fly in one note.
- And roll it up!  - One note.
- I think so.
Rolling!  And action.
We had a quick note.
Something to add.
Cut.
Who the fuck are you?  Tim Cramblin.
Cramblin Duvet Advertising.
We we actually met before your bath.
What the fuck are you doing here?  Uh oh, we actually  came up with the idea for this commercial.
Yeah, we have a couple of, uh, chairs with our names on them.
I don't give a shit.
Reilly.
I have a limited amount of time here.
I can't just have nobodies  wandering into frame and mucking it up.
I am I'm very sorry, Andy.
- We were just trying to help.
- You want to help?  Sit out of frame and shut the fuck up  while I film these Mini Caesars.
Again, so sorry.
Look, why don't you guys go back to your bloody chairs?  "Bloody"?  [SOFTLY.]
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
- What was the note? - What?  What was the fuckin' note that was so fuckin' important  that you had to interrupt my shot?  [SOFT CHUCKLE.]
Uh, mayb  Uh, maybe it could be "friggin' football"?  - [SOFT LAUGHING.]
- What?  [SOFT LAUGH.]
Instead of him saying just "a football,"  he says, "a friggin' football.
"  [BOTH LAUGHING SOFTLY.]
Are you fuckin' idiots?  [SHOUTING.]
Does anyone think that's funnier?  Anybody?  All right, then.
Okay, look, guys,  why don't you just get out of here, all right?  Yeah, that's all right, we'll  We'll go back to our chairs.
No.
I mean, get out of here.
Leave.
[MOODY FUNK MUSIC.]
How'd it go?  I ran to the restroom,  and I didn't see what just happened.
I saw that you saw.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Oh, I love you, Sam.
Thanks, but I don't need your help  'cause I'm not humiliated.
- [UPBEAT LOUNGE MUSIC.]
-   What are we even doing here?  That commercial got nominated for a D Award.
Let's just try to enjoy it.
We had nothing to do with it.
We got kicked off the set.
I choose to remember that  we walked away with our heads held high.
[DRUMROLL.]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage  Detroit's favorite son from  your favorite television show, "Martin.
"  Please welcome Cole from "Martin.
"  [ENTHUSED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
[ORCHESTRAL MUSICAL FLOURISH.]
[CHEERING AND WHISTLING.]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ah!  [CHEERING.]
What's up, Detroit?  I'm Carl Anthony Payne II.
Now, even though we actually  never filmed "Martin" in Detroit,  every time I would see all those beautiful exterior shots,  I would think, "Damn, such a nice place.
"  [ENTHUSED CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
All right, now, I know you guys are thinking  I came alone, right?  I brought Carl Anthony Payne III!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Now, the producers of the show,  they saw this bit and asked me not to do it.
They thought it wasn't good.
But I ask you guys.
Is this good?  [AS PUPPET.]
What's up, guys?  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to  Detroit's biggest night in advertising  [AS PUPPET.]
The D Awards!  [ORCHESTRAL FANFARE.]
[HOOTING.]
[TAME APPLAUSE.]
Congratulations.
All right, guys, it's time for the big one.
The D Award for Consumer TV 30-Second Single.
Here's our first nominee.
[GENTLE ACOUSTIC GUITAR MUSIC.]
Memories   Hide between these bricks     Picture frames   Hold picture perfect moments   They stole our pitch.
Don't flatter yourself.
A lot of people can have the same idea.
Turn all our stories   For love always wherever we go       [APPLAUSE.]
Next up, Better Made Chips  from Pomerantz and Klein.
Let's get a drink.
Memories hide between these bricks   See?  [DISTANT.]
Picture frames hold picture perfect   Can I have a Robert Palmer, please?  - Hey.
- "Pizza, pizza.
"  Can I whip this napkin at the back of your head?  Abso-fuckin'-lutely not.
There he is!  Oh, for Christ sake  Funny seeing you in here again.
Oh, I've seen that look before.
You're getting ready to take a big dump.
And in a minute, I'll be wiping your little bun  down with a wet towel  and pouring baby powder on your tuchus,  so your anus wouldn't turn red as Rudolph's nose.
Why were you always changing my diaper, man?  You're not even related to me.
You should not have been doing that.
Oh, jeez, kid.
Your dad would bring you into work,  and then he would get so busy he wouldn't have time  to take care of you, so I set up a spot for you in my office,  let you play with my old Matchbox cars,  and while all that was going on,  you'd take a lot of craps, and I'd clean 'em up.
Look, I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Oh, my God.
I'm I'm so sorry, Paul.
I had no idea.
Thank you for taking care of me.
Oh, yeah.
I just feel like I had a hand in raising you.
Now, why don't you hop up here for old time's sake?  - Paul - Aw, I'm just joking.
- Okay.
- I'm just proud of you.
But I bet your dumps are way bigger  and way messier.
I'd love to see 'em,  even if just in the toilet.
Oh, damn it.
Say it.
"Pizza, pizza.
"  Say it.
Let's get out of here.
Let's get our pea coats and go.
Let's get our pea coats and get out of here.
Mmm, delicious Little Caesars.
- Pizza, pizza.
- [LAUGHTER.]
And there you have it.
Even a football to the head won't stop you  from enjoying Little Caesars Pizza.
- Idiots.
- You're all sheep!  Well, no surprises here, guys.
The winner is: Little Caesars, Cramblin Duvet.
- Oh, my God! - We did it!  A fuckin' D Award!  Aah!  [UPBEAT MOTOWN MUSIC.]
You got me believing in you   [LAUGHS INCREDULOUSLY.]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
[LAUGHS.]
Uh ah.
When you know, when I was first  hit in the head with a football,  I-I thought, hmm, this would be a great commercial,  because it was funny, you know,  and I always thought it was funny.
Uh, and I was always in on the joke.
So, to you I say  welcome to the joke!  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
[CHUCKLES.]
Tim.
Commercials have the power to change the world.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]
You got me believing in you   It's weird.
All I've ever wanted  was to win a D Award.
Doesn't feel like I thought it would.
Yeah, that's 'cause we didn't do anything to win it.
That's right.
This is meaningless.
Hey, guys, congratulations.
- Suck it, pal.
- We beat you, you lost,  you're a piece of shit, and nobody loves you.
It's an empty victory.
Yeah, sure is.
Hey, fellas.
Congratulations.
- Oh.
- Yeah,  it was a great commercial.
Thank you so much, Carl, but honestly,  we had nothing to do with it.
Hmm.
You know  this reminds me of the time  "Martin" won the 1994 Image Award  for Outstanding Comedy Series.
- Oh, yeah, magical night.
- Yeah, of course.
- I remember that.
- Yeah, yeah, it was great.
Right? We won.
You know, but it didn't feel like my award.
Oh, yeah, 'cause you had to share it  with Martin and Tommy and Pam and Gina  and Sheneneh.
Well, Sheneneh was Martin.
But you know what, that's beside the point.
I mean, you know, that was just my ego talking.
You know what I'm saying?  I mean, since then I've learned to appreciate the achievement.
You know, you put it like that, it's pretty cool.
It's like the D Award is the Image Award,  and we're "Martin.
" [LAUGHS SOFTLY.]
No.
You're Cole from "Martin.
"  Well, that's pretty cool, too.
Oh, I know it is.
Take it easy, fellas.
- BOTH: Thanks, Carl.
- Appreciate it.
- Wait, Martin was Sheneneh? - I know!  - What the hell? - How?  I met the real Sheneneh once.
Yeah.
God bless you.
[STAMMERS.]
Thank you.
[STIFLED LAUGHTER.]
And never never  Let a teacher tell you that you're fat.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.]

Better Made Chips.
Can you believe it?  Sam, we won the biggest advertising award in the city.
Did we earn it?  No, but we gotta ride this wave.
Yeah, we can't go back to pitching mom and pop  furniture stores.
Yeah, and we won't.
In the past month, we've pitched Shinola.
- Tanked it.
- Bell Tire.
- We chunked it.
- Quicken Loans.
- Cried in the room.
- Downriver Ale.
Yeah, we haven't heard yet, but I feel really good  - about that one.
- Yeah, it was, like,  - our best pitch in months, man.
- [phone pings.]
- It was really good.
- It's a no.
God damn it!  Open on an elementary school cafeteria.
It's lunch time, and fifth graders are doing  what fifth graders do.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, "I'll trade you my apple  for your carrot sticks.
"  "Oh, I'll trade you my bologna sandwich for your PB&J.
"  Then the kids pulls out a bag of Better Made Potato Chips.
A silence falls over the room.
We see the principal walking towards the boy.
Then cut to we see the kid driving away  in a brand new Cadillac.
As the principal eats the kid's Better Made Chips.
Better Made Chips: the ultimate bargaining chip.
- [laughs.]
- [chuckles.]
Very nice.
It's just not the direction we wanna go into right now.
[chuckles.]
Uh, really? A no?  We just gave you a slam dunk pitch  followed by a homerun tagline.
- It was very nice.
- Aw, yeah,  but it's not the direction you wanna go in.
You want something a little edgier.
Yeah, maybe something like, "Better Made Potato Chips,  we're missing out on a good thing here.
"  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or "Better Made Chips: go fuck yourself.
"  - Well, very funny joke, Tim.
- No.
Tim writes all of our jokes.
Damn it, we needed that one.
I know, buddy.
We'll get the next one.
Yeah, but what if we don't get the next one?  Well, then we'll get the next one after that.
[funky music.]
- Is that Angel? - Yeah.
- What up, Proper? - Sup, sup, what up?  No, hello, how are you?  This is how I talk, so I don't need to feel  Sam, I'm pregnant.
- Good for you.
- It's yours.
[dramatic music.]
Next time   When they ask you   Where you're from   You gon' say Detroit city   When we get back on our feet, yeah   Yeah   Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be a dad.
All right, it's all good.
Whatever you need, I'm here for you.
Whatever you need.
What do you need?  Okay, I'm spinning out, I think.
It's like I've got a headache.
Actually, you know what?  My stomach hurts actually, actually, no, physically,  I'm fine.
I think this is just more of  - a mental thing, you know? - Okay.
You know, I'm good.
I'm fine.
- I should go tell my dad though.
- We should for sure  - tell your dad.
- [vomits, burps.]
Oh  You're okay, you're okay.
You're okay.
You all right?  All right, that was a big one.
- Look at that, stinky.
- I know, it just kept coming.
Hey, Tim.
[chuckles.]
Samuel, what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?  Dad, uh, can I talk to you in private?  Of course, of course.
Darren, give this man anything he wants.
- Darren, no alcohol.
- [groans.]
Okay, well, do you guys have Jolt?  No.
Do you have Surge? Thank you.
How do you know it's yours?  Well, we're taking a test, but  I didn't wear a prophylactic.
Well, then, Son, it's probably yours.
You see, when a man has sex with a woman  - and he ejaculates into her - No, yeah, I know.
- So how's this gonna work? - Well, uh, the baby  will live with Angel, and I'll be there to provide  whatever it needs.
What about money?  I mean, you're gonna need a steadier job.
I mean, I know you and Tim like to have fun,  but you're gonna need a career.
Son, it's time you come and work for me.
Dad, I have a job, all right?  I mean, things may be a little tough right now,  but, I mean, that's the ad game.
It's like a roller coaster.
Not here, Son.
Royals Steakhouse is a monorail,  a safe and dependable monorail.
I mean, would you put a baby on a roller coaster?  Well, it depends on how tall the baby is, I guess.
I don't understand you   I mean, we are this close to setting up a meeting with Dodge.
Great, we need to pick things up around here,  you know what I mean?  Let's set up some meetings with some clients we have  a realistic chance of landing.
- [elevator dings.]
- We have a realistic chance  of landing Dodge.
Dodge called.
It's a no.
God damn it!  They don't even wanna meet with us?  Did you go to that guy's house?  I used to live in that house.
I just wanted to look around.
He sounded pretty upset.
My car broke down in front of his house.
I just needed to use the phone.
- Tim, which is it? - I saw a kid on the roof.
He was about to jump.
What  We can't keep relying on these pipe dreams.
We need stability.
I mean, would you take a baby on a roller coaster?  I mean, like, to save its life?  Yeah!  And then you say, "At Wonderground,  we understand the sound of music.
"  That's great, wow.
Then Santa says, "I know what I'm getting everyone  this Christmas: bass guitars!"  That's good because I'm up to my hog in bass guitars.
No, we know.
That's why this commercial  is perfect for you.
Yeah, it's great.
I just need a couple days to think about it.
- Jam on it.
- Sure, yep.
- Take as much time as you need.
- Or, better yet,  just say yes right now.
Okay, guys, I'll be in touch.
Better yet, be in touch right now.
- Just say yes.
- Sam.
I have to think about it and jam on it a little.
Tim, the man has to jam on it.
What the hell's there to jam on?  You have to jam on the idea.
The idea is perfect.
I mean, it's simple, it's funny,  and it's the only way you're gonna sell  your friggin' bass guitars.
Jam session over.
You don't say when the jam session's over!  No one does! It just kind of fizzles out.
You lose the groove, and it fizzles out.
You know what? The answer's no.
Sure, that's okay, that's okay.
- Come on, let's - No, it's not, Tim!  - Yeah.
- I'm sorry, but the jam  session you don't tell me when the jam session ends.
- I know you don't.
- It fizzles out.
- It fizzles out.
- People drop out one by one,  and then it's over.
- Are you okay? - I gotta get out of here.
[smooth music.]
I know you got something that you wanna say   Tell it to my face   You really freaked out on Crazy Terrance.
That's usually my move.
That should've been an easy yes.
Screw it, we'll get the next one.
I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow morning,  we'll go after Dodge, baby.
Tim, we're not gonna land Dodge.
Buddy, I don't think I can do this job anymore.
Well, what are you talking about?  We'll make it work.
What are you gonna do? Go work for your dad?  I mean, it is steady work.
You hate working for your dad.
He controls you.
He doesn't let you fly like I do.
Well, you don't let me fly, Tim, all right?  - I'm my own bird.
- No, I just  that's what I'm saying.
I'm saying we're both birds.
I've gotta leave the company.
We're in a slump, Sam, and you're freaking out.
It's gonna be fine.
I'll take a pay cut.
Chrissy makes good money.
I'll live off that for a little while.
Buddy, you already live off Chrissy's paycheck.
- I forgot I told you that.
- Yeah.
Tim, there's nothing I want more  than to say at Cramblin Duvet, but I've gotta do this.
For my kid.
All right, I understand.
And I wish you the best of luck.
And I want you to know that I'm 100% fine with this.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, it's all good.
It's all [coughs.]
Whoa, wow.
Oh, there he goes.
- [coughing.]
- There he goes.
You got it, bud.
- [coughing.]
- You good?  You good?  [jazz music.]
I never realized that other girls   That love you want to know   I never realized how much you need your love   To keep my vow   So don't grow with me and go away   I'll never be the same again   For without you by my side, baby, it's the end   All right, huddle up, everybody.
Huddle up, I have an announcement to make.
As you know, Sam is no longer with the company,  and none of you can replace him.
So everybody's going to have to step it up around here  to make sure that I have a good time.
I'm bored, and I've been bored all morning.
Work should be fun for me.
All right?  All right, cool.
Back to what you were doing.
Thank you, everybody.
I mean, I don't know.
Tommy, yeah, like, maybe get a big ol' suit,  biggest one you can find.
Tons of buttons.
Big ol' floppy hat.
Maybe you're clumsy and you drop stuff all the time.
Like Mr.
Bean?  Uh, yeah, but make it your own, Tommy.
You know, maybe lose your watch in a turkey.
Sounds like Mr.
Bean.
Yeah, but Tommy can talk, Sheila!  What? No, Tommy, you don't  - have to do that.
- Yes, he does, Lea.
You all do!  That's what this place is now.
It's wearing big ol' suits with buttons and dropping shit!  And if you don't like it, you can quit like Sam did,  and I'll blow my brains out!  Sheila, get Dodge on the phone.
Thank you!  [slam.]
[screaming.]
I can't do this!  Yeah, we sold 25 cheesecakes tonight.
- Is that good? - Is 25 cheesecakes  - in one night good? - I don't know.
- It's great.
- Another round?  Uh, I should probably get going.
- Pretty big day tomorrow.
- Yeah, me too.
I'm getting really close with Dodge.
Just stay away from that guy, Tim.
This is on me.
Industry discount.
See you, buddy.
Hey, I saw your buddy left.
You looking for a new friend?  Get out of here, man.
I was just trying to be nice.
This is what I get for trying to be nice.
Oh, God.
- So - Ah.
- What you think? - This is really nice.
Yeah? It's a work in progress.
I wanted to do this under the sea thing.
My cousin said he could paint fish, but he couldn't.
Oh, my God, you gotta get rid of that before the baby comes.
I know, and the mermaid is even worse.
Oh, well, I got you some things.
Let's see, I got you some vitamins.
Got you a baby book, and I got you a romance novel for Mom.
[squeals.]
It's "Teaching Michael Chestly,"  from the Michael Chestly series.
It's really sensual.
Thanks, Sam.
You know, you are doing a lot, but you really don't have to  do all this because we're not together, and we never will be.
I think we're on the same page.
That was just a little too definitive for it  - not to hurt my feelings.
- Thanks.
Oh!  It's got a bush?  He said it was historically accurate.
Huh, well, I should probably get going to work,  but do you mind?  - Yeah? - Oh, okay.
I'll stand by you   I'll stand by you   I won't let nobody hurt you   I'll stand by you   Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- [piano music.]
- Hope he's doing a good job.
Billy, no jazz.
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Sam.
This is Bruce from 1-2-3 Warehouse.
Just a new client to I've added to our portfolio.
I know he's just a small fish, but still fun to reel in.
- I'm not a small fish.
- But you are, you are.
Yeah, of course, Bruce, welcome to Royals.
I ate here once before.
Well, then, welcome back.
Yep, just pitching Bruce here some taglines.
You know, closing the deal.
You used to do that.
- Wanna sit in? - No, Tim, I can't.
But you've got this.
Bruce, you're in excellent hands.
Enjoy your meals, fellas.
It's on me.
- Oh.
- Not the booze, though.
So I was wrong, he's not gonna join us.
No worries, I can do it myself.
Uh, so we see beauty shots of your wonderful appliances.
A family walks through the store holding a map.
The announcer comes on, "1-2-3 Warehouse.
"Where's the warehouse?  It's as easy as 1-2-3 Warehouse.
"  It's going to seem like they're lost in the store.
Okay, you don't like that? Here's another one.
"1-2-3 Warehouse,  it's as easy as A-B-C.
Warehouse.
"  My main competitor is A-B-C Warehouse.
Uh, that's insane.
All right, well, just take that off their check,  and then give them a free dessert.
- Okay.
- Thanks, Darren.
- Hey, don't grab me! - I didn't grab you!  You looked away when I was talking to you.
I'm not gonna apologize for something that I didn't do.
- You grabbed my shirt.
- Shirt!  So you admit that I didn't grab you!  Uh, gentlemen, some wine for the table.
Sorry to interrupt, but how about something like  "1-2-3 Warehouse: you can count on us.
"  I love it.
Because you can count  on 1-2-3.
That's perfect.
It is.
It is, perfect.
Sam, come back.
Tell me you didn't get a rush from that.
Clients are coming in now.
Way better than this guy, trust me.
- Hey.
- Tim, I'm not coming back.
Look, in ten years, I'm gonna be managing  four of these restaurants.
And, hopefully, Cramblin Duvet's the biggest  ad agency in Detroit, but, Tim, I can't gamble on hopefully.
'Cause in 10 years my kid's gonna be nine,  and, if he's anything like me, he's gonna need braces  for his legs 'cause his dick's so big.
Good luck, buddy.
I love ya.
Love you too.
All right, okay.
Well, we can't use "you can count on us"  for legal reasons, plus I refuse to do that.
But I'll come up with something just as good.
Um, one  Look at me when I'm talking to you!  [smooth music.]
It'll be like, "No job's too small, no job's too big.
We're father and son.
Give us the gig.
"  I don't know.
It might be a little corny.
You run a business with your son, and I'm corny?  You couldn't even find another grown man  - to go into business with.
- Hey.
What's the story here? Is this a yes or no?  - I got shit to do.
- I think it goes  without saying you're not getting the job.
Yeah, and I think it goes without saying  that you should get out 'cause one of you's ugly,  and it runs in the family.
- Let's go.
- Bye.
Later, dude.
Shut the door, shut the light off.
[yells.]
Don't look at me!  [sighs.]
Well, that's it.
We're shutting down.
Call Dodge and tell them we're out.
I will continue to commute to work,  but my briefcase will be empty.
I will no longer pursue new clients, and I will  do nothing to keep the ones we have,  and I ask you to do the same.
We will keep going until the money runs out,  then we die.
So from now on, it's Camp Do What You Wanna.
Tommy, keep wearing the big suit, please.
Thank you, Tommy.
It's very funny.
[chatter.]
[door opens.]
[chatter.]
- Hello, table for two? - Oh, it's just me.
No, I know, you're pregnant, so it's like a little joke.
'Cause like you'd be eating for two  - Look, Sam.
- It's a joke.
There's no good way to tell you this,  but it's not your baby.
Excuse me?  Yeah, I just got the test results back.
I'm sorry.
I just got a little confused  with the timeline, and then, I mean, I figured it was  probably you, and then you were so sweet,  and I guess I just convinced myself that it had to be you,  and it ain't.
So I'm not gonna be a father.
Good news, right?  Great news, that's the last thing I wanted.
You know what I mean? Like, being a father  - is such a burden.
- Right.
Yeah, it'd be like, you know, you gotta look out  for this little baby who looks up to you his whole life.
[laughs.]
Matching baby Lions onesies.
- Yeah.
- So glad I didn't buy  - 12 of those.
- Who would do that?  - Who would do that? - Stupid.
Just dumb.
Well, whoever the real father is,  he's a very lucky man.
- Angel, let me hold a dollar.
- Okay.
Going across to the gas station, get some combos.
- Okay, baby.
- Sup, Playboy?  - Thank you, babe.
- Who is this?  My name is Pleasure.
Well, Pleasure, you're obviously very handsome.
Your sperm is clearly stronger than mine,  - so congratulations.
- You're right,  he does talk like Tavis Smiley.
Good.
I'm glad I do.
Uh, good-bye, Sam.
Bye, Angel.
Take care of that baby.
[chuckles.]
I wish it was mine.
I wish it was mine.
[dramatic music.]
Good to know you   Got to find some way   To keep you in my arms   And to love you     I got to feel you   Wandering   You   Come on   [upbeat music.]
What? What?    Yes, yes! Yes!  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  Yes!  - I am not the father.
- You're shooting blanks.
No, it could be a lot of the different possibilities.
Sam, you keep your phone right by your crotch.
- No, it's not that.
- You're shooting blanks.
I mean, everybody keeps their phone sometimes it's  in my back pocket, so it's not it, so.
I'm sorry, man.
I think you would've been a great dad.
Thanks, pal,  But I am so glad to have you back.
[chuckles.]
Me too.
- You're my best friend, Tim.
- You're my best friend.
And in ten years, we're gonna have the biggest  ad agency in Detroit, and that's a fuckin' promise.
Let's go get Dodge.
I think it's best if we just give that guy and his family  a little bit of space.
Tim, what did you do?  From the gentleman at the end of the bar.
Congratulations.
When you were gone, me and him used to be best friends.
No, we weren't.
Shut up, Ramon.
Inside joke.
- Is that true? - No, of course not.
Well, he only got us one beer.
It's annual friendship day here in Detroit.
That's why I brought my best friend, Dave,  to hang out.
He's a slob, but I love him.
-  Ooh  - Good night, Detroit.
[machinery whirring.]
- Come on, let's go.
- All right, all right.
