TIM: Obviously I’d love to work for you, and I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me. I… I feel good about it. I hope I didn’t do too much talking.
INTERVIEWER: No, you were great.
TIM: [GIGGLES] I hope to hear from you soon.
INTERVIEWER: We’ll be in touch. Really nice meeting you. [EXTENDS HAND]
TIM: Nice to meet you as well.
INTERVIEWER: Okay. [TIM GETS UP TO OPEN DOOR, IT CLICKS] Oh, looks like you push.
TIM: Oh, it does both.
INTERVIEWER: What?
TIM: It does both. I was here yesterday, and it actually goes both ways.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, okay.
TIM: Okay, see you. [MENACING MUSIC, CREAKING AND GRINDING AS TIM BREAKS DOOR BY PULLING IT OPEN, TIM DROOLS] See? Hope to hear from you soon. 
1.2 Has This Ever Happened To You
A very specific legal problem.
MITCH BRYANT: [IN AD] Have you been the victim of unfair treatment by a business or a corporation? Has this ever happened to you? You bought a house, it was not disclosed to you that there was a termite infestation in the walls and in the moldings, so you have to take it upon yourself to call your own termite extermination company, [KNOCKING ON DOOR] but when the guys show up, they immediately ask if they can use your bathroom, then for two hours, they take turns going in and out of there, taking huge mudpies and over-flushing? Then they go in there together, and you hear a bunch of scrounging around, and then you hear a bunch of yelling, and one of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friend’s foot is stuck in the toilet, and he says “Help him! You’ve gotta help him!” And when you go in there to help him, he just pulls his foot out easily and laughs ‘cause his foot wasn’t stuck. It wasn’t stuck at all, he was just faking it. And then they get really serious and say, “It’s Turbo Time!” And they both start running around the house as fast as they can and jumping over the couches. But when you try and jump in they yell at you and they say, “You’re not part of the Turbo Team! Don’t run! You don’t run with us! We’re the ones who run! Until you’re part of this Turbo Team, walk… slowly!”
	So you go lay down to be by yourself and read your art books, but then the next day you went into the bathroom, and it looked like the hole in your toilet had shrunk. And you said, “How could that be? There’s no way they could have shrunk the toilet.” But then you saw in the trash a receipt from home depot for a toilet the exact same size as yours, but with a joke hole that’s just for farts! They replaced your real toilet with a fart toilet, and now you can’t take a dump in your own house ‘cause your toilet can’t suck ‘em down and you feel sick to your stomach! Has that ever happened to you?!
Call me right now, please.
1.3 Baby of the Year
Things get ugly at the "Baby of the Year" contest.
HOST: [SINGING] Who will be the Baby of the Year? Look at their rolls. Look at their folds. Look at their rummy, bummy tummies. Heads are round. Bellies are squishy. [HARD ROCK STYLE] Look at their toes, like so many curled canned shrimp. [BACK TO NORMAL SINGING] Are they ticklish? Are they jigglish? Can they be tricked? Can they be chucked? Which one will move? Which ones will talk? But more importantly - which ones can dance? Oh. Who will be the Baby of the Year?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Welcome back. It’s been a grueling three months, but we’ve narrowed it down to three chubby little babies. 
[APPLAUSE] 
From Salisbury, North Carolina, Michael Patrick Porkins. 
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
From Luverne, North Dakota, little Taffy Lee Fubbins.
[APPLAUSE] 
And the bad boy of the competition, Bart Harley Jarvis.

KIM: I have firmly made up my mind.
JENNIFER: I would like more information.
GREG: I’m a wreck right now. 
HOST: I understand. This is a hard decision. Let’s hear once again from the babies’ pediatrician. 
[APPLAUSE] 
DR. SKULL: Baby Porkins is 99th percentile in weight and 10th percentile in height.
HOST: [GIGGLES] We got a certified chode on our hands. Little tuna can.
DR. SKULL: Baby Fubbins is also 90th percentile in weight. 
HOST: Ooh! Another chode.
DR. SKULL: Mr. Jarvis is one of the most aggressive babies I’ve ever met. 
[AUDIENCE BOOING]
DR. SKULL: He has a massive underbite and completely flat back of the head.
AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I hope you fucking die, Harley Jarvis!
HOST: Get. Him. Out of here!
DR. SKULL: I’m honestly done. I don’t want to read anymore. 
HOST: Yeah. Don’t let it ruin your day, okay? You’re still a great doctor. All right, judges, do you need more time?
KIM: It’s Porkins by a mile. [APPLAUSE] The button nose, the apple cheeks. He’s the best baby.
JENNIFER: If Taffy Lee Fubbins isn’t the Best Baby of the Year, I’ll kill myself on live TV. 
KIM: Stop saying that!
GREG: All right, that...that’s it. I have to get this off my chest. [READING] “Earlier today, when I was waiting to use the private bathroom, I witnessed Michael Patrick Porkins’ father performing oral on the mystery judge of the competition. I’ve been conflicted about whether to say anything, because I feel like Michael Patrick Porkins Could win it without the oral. His father didn’t need to do the oral. And that is why it is so tough for me to tell about the oral.”
HOST: Oh, man that’s a bummer. Might fuck this whole thing up. While the judges make their decision, let’s watch our In Memoriam segment.
GREG: Oh, no. 
HOST: Calm down, they’re old ones. They don’t stay babies forever, idiot. Fucking stupid asshole.
[GENTLE ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYING]
IN MEMORIAM: Little Denny Doo Dinkins, 92, respiratory failure. Shirley Cratsworth Shane, 78, car crash.
KIM: In Memoriams don’t usually include how they died.
HOST: Shut up. 
IN MEMORIAM: Little Jeffy Jeremy, 96, throat slashed. 
KIM: God...
[GLASS SHATTERS. WOMAN SCREAMING]
HOST: Someone get her! She’s trying to get Jarvis! 
All right, you know what? This is dumb. Dump it. Trash it. This one’s garbage. 
IN MEMORIAM: Tiny Dinky Daffy, 92, pancaked by drunk dump truck driver. 
1.4 Instagram
[CAMERA CLICKS]
WOMAN #1: Let me see it. Oh, yeah, that’s good. That’s great.
WOMAN #2: Thank you. 
BRENDA: Thank you. Is it cute?
WOMAN #1: Yeah, so cute. 
WOMAN #2: Send it to me.
BRENDA: Me too.
WOMAN #1: Yeah, okay. Sending now. Okay. Look what I just posted. “Brunch with these two dumdums.”
WOMAN #2: Oh, my gosh, so good. Is this good? I said “Sunday funday with these idiots.”
WOMAN #1: Yeah, that’s good. That’s great. So cute.
BRENDA: So cute. Okay, okay, so cute. Look what I just posted. “Eating crap with these sacks of shit. If they died tomorrow, no one would shed a tear.” So cute?
WOMAN #1: Wait, what the hell?
BRENDA: Well, you called me a dumdum, and she called me an idiot, so…
WOMAN #2: Yeah, when you post a pic of yourself where you look really cute, you have to say something a little self-deprecating so it doesn’t look like you’re just bragging.
BRENDA: Oh, okay! Got it. Sorry.
WOMAN #1: Yeah.
BRENDA: Alright, this is good. 
WOMAN #1: Okay.
BRENDA: “Slapping down some pig shit with these fat fucks, and I’m the fattest of them all. If I died tomorrow, no one would shed a tear. Load my fricking lard carcass into the mud. No coffin, please, just wet, wet mud. Bae.”
WOMAN #1: Jesus, Brenda…
BRENDA: You called me a dumdum.
WOMAN #1: Right, it’s like a term of endearment.
BRENDA: Okay. All right. I got you. 
WOMAN #1: Okay.
BRENDA: Okay. “Gulping down some pig dicks with these bags of meat. Sunday funday with these pig dicks. Hope nobody gulps us.” 
WOMAN #2: So are we the pig dicks or the bags of meat?
BRENDA: Let me try another. “Slurping down fish piss with these wet chodes. Total tuna cans. Put a bullet in their fucking brains and leave their wet bodies on the side of the road. Boo caught me sleeping.
WOMAN #1: You’re not sleeping.
BRENDA: Okay, let me try another one.
WOMAN #1: Okay,
 “Sitting here with two bona fide pieces of hog shit…They’re mad because I won Best Hog at the hog shit snarfing contest, but I’m not mad, ‘cause we’re all loads of beef, sitting on the side of the highway, getting our butts sucked by flies.” I tagged you both in that.
WOMAN #1: Why?
BRENDA: Why are you guys bullying me?
1.5 Gift Receipt
A gift receipt causes stress.
JACOB: Alright, I’m gonna… Maybe I’ll go for this one?
WOMAN: Oh that could be a good one
JACOB: Is this, is this you?
WOMAN: Yeah.
JACOB: Oh my… this is perfect. [OVER SHOULDER] Babe, we were just talking about how we need a new salt and pepper shaker set. Remember this? [BACK TO WOMAN] Thank you. This is incredible.
WOMAN: Oh, I’m so glad you like it. But there’s a gift receipt in there in case you want to get something that’s… 
JACOB: Won’t need it, ‘cause this is perfect. Thank you.
[THEY EMBRACE]
WOMAN: Happy birthday.
JACOB: Thank you.
LEV: That one’s mine. I forgot to put my name on it.
JACOB: Cool, alright.
[OPENS GIFT]
JACOB: Cool.
LEV: Yeah, it’s a wreath. The guy at the store said he had the same one. He said it works great.
JACOB: Thank you so much, Lev.
LEV: Yeah, there’s a gift receipt in there if you want to exchange it for something that’s more you. 
JACOB: Okay, cool. Thanks.
LEV: But you like it.
JACOB: I like it, Lev.
LEV: Great. [PAUSE] Then give me back the receipt.
JACOB: What?
LEV: Prove it. You said you like it. Give me back the gift receipt. You don’t need it anymore. 
WOMAN: Lev, he likes the gift.
JACOB: You know what, I’m just gonna put all this stuff together in the same pile over here, if that’s cool? Okay. Ooh! [GRABS ANOTHER GIFT] I think I know who this is from.
LEV: If you love it as much as you say you do and as much as you have been saying… then it shouldn’t be a problem if I take the receipt back.
JACOB: Okay. Yeah. [EXTENDS RECEIPT] Here you go. Jesus.
LEV: Glad you like it. Happy birthday.
JACOB: Thanks. Um, let… let me open… who…?
MELISSA: Oh, that one’s ours.
JACOB: Alright. [OPENS GIFT, LAUGHS] Are you serious? Firefighter pugs? Honey, we gotta go put this up on our fridge this is incredible!
MELISSA: We just thought it was cute.
LEV: And you’d be fine if I ate it?
JACOB: Huh?
LEV: The gift receipt. You’d be fine if I ate it?
JACOB: Why would you eat it?
LEV: You said you liked the gift. So you wouldn’t have any qualms if I ate the gift receipt and it didn’t exist anymore. Right, Rick? Right, Melissa?
JACOB: Uh… I don’t have any qualms. You can eat it if you like.
LEV: Awesome. Down the hatch, bon appetit. 
[SLOWLY EATS RECEIPT. SHRUGS]
MELISSA: Should we open another gift?
JACOB: Ye… yes. [CHUCKLES] yes. Uh, okay, how about this one?
[GRABS ANOTHER GIFT]
JACOB: I think I know what’s in this one. [OPENS BOX, PICKS UP BOOK] Oh, whoa! Hey! I just heard an interview of this guy! This is so interesting, thank you!
LEV: I hate to do this, but I’m afraid our gracious host didn’t wipe properly. 
JACOB: What are you talking about?
LEV: When you went to the bathroom earlier to do the mud pie… you must have used too small of a slice of toilet paper when you wiped, and you got mud pie on your hands, and then you touched the receipt, and then I ate the receipt, and now I’m sick off your mud pie.
JACOB: [UPSET] What the hell are you talking about? You’re probably sick because you ate paper, you fricking psycho.
LEV: [YELLING] No, I eat paper all the time! What I don’t like to make a habit of doing is eating mud pie!
JACOB: [YELLING] Why do you even eat paper?! That doesn’t even make sense!
WOMAN: Okay, you guys, calm down! This is insane! There’s a simple solution to this. Jacob hasn’t touched my gift receipt because he likes my gift. So we just have someone else eat my gift receipt and see if they get sick.
LEV: But it can’t be Jacob, ‘cause he’s gonna pretend he’s not sick even if it’s caked in pure shit.
MELISSA: I’ll do it. I’ll eat the receipt to solve the problem.
LEV: And Jacob doesn’t touch it!
WOMAN: That’s right. And if Melissa gets sick, then that means that paper makes you sick. But if Melissa doesn’t get sick, then that means Lev ate the mud pie. 
JACOB: There is no mud pies, okay? And I genuinely like the gifts.
RICK: Swear to fucking god? 
JACOB: Yes. 
RICK: Then let my wife eat the fucking receipt.
[MURMURING FROM PARTY GUESTS]
JACOB: Oka… Okay.
MELISSA: [SPRAYING HANDS] I am now sanitizing my hands. I have not gone to the bathroom yet today. I took a shower last night after I took a piss and shit. Now… someone, hand me the receipt.
[JACOB REACHES FOR RECEIPT]
LEV: [IN HYSTERICS] Jacob, don’t you get anywhere near that!
[RICK HANDS MELISSA RECEIPT. MELISSA INHALES DEEPLY. EATS RECEIPT]
RICK: How you doing, honey?
MELISSA: I feel… [PAUSE] fine. 
Oooop
[PARTY GUESTS GASP COLLECTIVELY]
MELISSA: Paper doesn’t make you sick on its own. [POINTS AT JACOB] he used too small a piece.
JACOB: Lev’s probably not even sick! He’s probably faking it!
LEV: You son of a bitch! [GROANS IN PAIN]
RICK: Jacob was lying about the mud pie! And if he was lying about something as simple as grabbing too small a slice, that probably means he doesn’t like the gift either.
LEV: Exactly!
WOMAN: But you liked my gift, right, Jacob?
JACOB: Yes!
WOMAN: What about Rick and Melissa’s?
[PAUSE}
RICK: [YELLING] You piece of shit!
[RICK PUNCHES PILLOW OFF COUCH]
MELISSA: Rick!
RICK: Fuck! [PUTS HEAD IN HANDS]
LEV: Somebody call 911. Tell ‘em to send an ambulance… 
JACOB: Oh my god…
LEV: Tell ‘em it's… the ugly house on Kenmore. The one where you can see the KFC sign through their front window.
[WOMAN 2 APPROACHES WITH A CAKE SINGING “HAPPY BIRTHDAY”]
WOMAN: No! Don’t let Jacob touch that!
[WOMAN SLAPS CAKE OUT OF WOMAN 2’S HANDS ONTO GROUND. PARTY GUESTS GASP]
RICK: Everybody, let’s get out of here. This place is covered head-to-toe in shit.
[FOOTSTEPS AUDIBLE AS EVERYONE LEAVES. JACOB SIGHS, PUTS HEAD IN HANDS]
LEV: All you had to do… was like the gift… and not have a big ol’ mud pie on the bottom of your butt. It’s not a big deal. You had a big mud pie, you had too small a slice, then I ate the mud pie, now my stomach’s absolutely fucked. [REACHES OVER TO TOUCH JACOB] Shouldn’t have had such a sloppy mud pie… 
JACOB: Get off me, man.
LEV: Fine! [STANDS] Nobody likes your house anyway. 
[MELANCHOLIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS. LEV WALKS TO DOORWAY]
LEV: You should know, your wife kissed me on the cheek when I got here. Now look at you… all alone. Everybody’s going to party at my house. Happy birthday, Jacob.
[JACOB’S WIFE ENTERS]
JACOB: I just… I was just trying not to use a ton of paper towel. 
JACOB’S WIFE: I just hope Lev’s alright. 
[OUTSIDE HOUSE, CAMERA INSIDE CAR LOOKING OUT WINDOW]
WOMAN: Okay, you guys, I’ve got Lev in my car, so just follow us. [ENTERS DRIVERS SIDE] Lev, what’s your address?

2.2 River Mountain High
A nifty new tug-friendly t-shirt.
WOMAN VO: River Mountain High is sponsored by TC Topps TC Tuggers Shirts, the only shirt with a tugging knob.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
[INDISTINCT STUDENT CHATTER]
BRANDON: Hey. Am I seeing you tonight?
CLAIRE: I don't know, Brandon. I shouldn't even be talking to you.
BRANDON: What's going on with you? You've been avoiding me all week.
CLAIRE: You're hiding something. What happened that night with Riley?
BRANDON: Look, I told you, we got in a fight, and she stormed off. That was the last I saw of her.
CLAIRE: Then why did Tyler see her in your car at 2 A.M.?
BRANDON: Oh, God, Tyler! Tyler's a freak. Everybody knows that.
CLAIRE: He may be weird, but at least he didn't beat up Matt Simms in the locker room in front of everyone.
BRANDON: Okay. Look... you can't say anything, but–
PRINCIPAL S: All right, you two, get to class. The bell already rang, you can't be in the hall when the bell rang. The bell already rang.
BRANDON: Sorry, Principal S.
PRINCIPAL S: That's okay.
[PRINCIPAL S TUGS ON A LITTLE KNOB ON THE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT]
CLAIRE: That’s a cool shirt.
PRINCIPAL S: Yeah, it’s a TC Topp from TC Tuggers, the only shirt that’s got a little knob on the front so you can just pull it out when it gets trapped on your belly.
BRANDON: It’s very cool.
PRINCIPAL S: Yeah, I was doing this all the time—
[PRINCIPAL S TUGS ON HIS SHIRT WITHOUT USING THE KNOB]
PRINCIPAL S: and the wear and tear was wrecking all my regular shirts. But TC Tuggers has this little knob on the front so you don’t wreck your shirt, or hurt your hand.
BRANDON: Yeah, that makes sense.
PRINCIPAL S: (speaking very loudly) Yeah, you know what I mean? Because when you go through the day, your shirt gets kind of bunched up, so I was wrecking my shirts ‘cause I was pulling them out subconsciously, but this has that knob, so you can just do it easily.
CLAIRE: Awesome. Well, we’ll get to class.
PRINCIPAL S: But they’re not a joke.
CLAIRE: What?
PRINCIPAL S: You don’t make jokes about ‘em, TC Tuggers. You don’t wear ‘em as a joke, you don’t give ‘em as a joke gift, or wear them ironically, or do pub crawls in ‘em like the Snuggie. They’re not like the Snuggie.
CLAIRE: Do they come in other styles?
[PRINCIPAL S PAUSES, RAISES INDEX FINGER, AND TAKES A LONG, DESPERATE DRINK OF WATER]
PRINCIPAL S: Not really.
[SKETCH CUTS TO “WILSON’S TOUPEES”]

CLAIRE: (to Brandon) You're hiding something. What happened that night with Riley?
CLAIRE: (to Principal S) That's a cool shirt.
PRINCIPAL S: Yeah, it's a TC Topp from TC Tuggers.
CLAIRE: Do they come in other styles?
PRINCIPAL S: Not really. No, yeah, the style is just... Is just basically this.
CLAIRE: Well, thanks, Principal S.
PRINCIPAL S: Yeah. Yeah, thank you for asking about the shirt and thinking it's cool, TC Tuggers. Yeah, I gotta go. Bye, Brandon. Think about what I said about TC Tuggers. Bye, Claire.
CLAIRE: (to Brandon) So, what happened with Riley?

WOMAN: Hey, cool hair Dave. 
DAVE: Thank you. I know. 
[bald man continues making burbling noises and gestures]
DAVE: [TO HIMSELF] He’s so comfortable in his skin.
[CUT TO CELEBRITY SPOKESPERSON, BRUNO AMATO]
BRUNO AMATO: You’ve been wearing a toupee for years, but you’re tired of living a lie. You’re ready to accept the real you, but you’re in too deep. You can’t go from hair to bald in one day.
[BACK TO OFFICE, DAVE IS BALD ON TOP]
WOMAN #2: Hey, Dave. [MENACING MUSIC PLAYS AS COWORKERS NOTICE BALD SPOT] Dave?
MAN #2: Oh, my God, Dave. You’re all-the-way bald. 
WOMAN #2: What happened to the head of hair you had yesterday? 
DAVE: Uhhhh…
WOMAN #2: Was that a toupee, you piece of shit?
DAVE: Dang it. [CUT BACK TO SPOKESPERSON]
BRUNO AMATO: Well, now you can wean yourself off your toupee gently with Wilson’s natural hair-loss system. It’s easy.

The prank doesn't go so well.
[COWORKERS GATHERED IN A BOARD ROOM FOR MEETING, MAN STAYS ON LOOK OUT AS JANE PLACES WHOOPEE CUSHION ON EMPTY CHAIR]
MAN: Here he comes. [EVERYONE SITS DOWN]
GUY: Sorry I’m late, everyone. It’s very rude of me. I apologize. [FART SOUND AS HE SITS, GROUP LAUGHS] 
GUY: [WHISPERING] Oh, my God, I farted. [GROUP STOPS LAUGHING] Um… Sorry about that, everyone. Could you excuse me for a second? I have to figure out what’s going on. [GUY STANDS UP AND SEES WHOOPEE CUSHION ON HIS SEAT] What the heck? There’s a pink bag on my chair? 
MAN: Yeah, it’s just a whoopee cushion. It’s a prank.
GUY: On me?
JANE: No, it… You know, it’s just a joke. 
GUY: What’s the joke, exactly? 
JANE: What do you mean?
GUY: My farts don’t sound anything like that. My farts are long… and way louder. And they reek. So what’s the joke? That I had a milder fart than I normally do? That nobody’s puking from my fart? Is that the joke? That I farted and no one barfed? ‘Cause that’s pretty funny, actually. That’d be a great day for me. That’d be a great day for me, if I farted and nobody barfed. 
JANE: That’s not the joke. It was just like… you know, what if you farted? 
GUY: [LOUDLY AND ANNOYED] I think we covered what would happen if I farted, Jane. You’d throw up your pretty little lunch. 
MAN: Okay, everyone, I think it’s time to start the meeting. The whoopee cushion thing was stupid. [GUY SLOWLY SITS BACK DOWN WITH CONFUSED FACE] Uh, Dana, you wanna bring us up to speed on what’s happening in the Midwest division? 
GUY: Can I just ask… What’s next? Just so I know, what’s next? 
MAN: Sorry? 
GUY: Cake batter in my pants, and make it look like I cum in my pants? 
JANE: What are you talking about? 
GUY: What’s the next joke? Meatball down my leg, make it look like my ball sack ripped open? Brown pie in my undies, make it look like I shit my pants? Brown pudding in my shoes, make it look like I shooted diarrhea down my leg? Make me think I’m mighty sick? I’m rushed to the hospital, and there for hours, and I miss my family photo tonight. Is that the joke? That I miss my family photo tonight? 
JANE: Nobody wants you to miss your family photos. 
GUY: Then what’s the joke? That while I’m on the operating table, a man is rushed in ‘cause he was in a car accident, and he has a metal bolt through his head, but he bleeds out in the waiting room because the doctors are too busy trying to shove two meatballs in my scrotum and cake batter in my penis? Is that the joke… [CONCERNED FACE] on the man’s widow? You got her, Jane. [CHUCKLES] You really got her. [GROUP LOOKS UNCOMFORTABLE] [GUY CONTINUES, YELLING] THIS IS A BETRAYAL ON LEVELS THAT NO ONE’S EVER SEEN!

GUY: [LOOKING AROUND THE TABLE] Thank you.

MAN: Just all of it, pretty much. 
CREEPY MAN: [LAUGHS] Lots to do, yeah. You’re gonna need your energy. 
WOMAN: Yeah. Yeah, I guess we are. 
CREEPY MAN: You know, you want to make it your dream vacation. 
MAN: Yep. 
WOMAN: Are you going on a vacation, too? 
CREEPY MAN: Oh, no, no, not me. 
MAN: Oh, business then, huh? 
CREEPY MAN: [LAUGHS] In a way. 
MAN: Well, we should probably get some shut-eye, so… 
CREEPY MAN: Good. That sounds like a good idea, yeah. [COUPLE CLOSES THEIR EYES AND GETS COMFY] [CREEPY MAN LEANS IN VERY CLOSE TO MAN’S FACE] [EERIE XYLOPHONE PLAYING] 
♪ Hush, little baby, don’t say a word ♪ 
♪ Mama’s gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪
MAN: [OPENS EYES] I’m… I’m sorry, do I know you? 
CREEPY MAN: No… [IN SING-SONG VOICE] but I know you. [CHUCKLES WICKEDLY] It was 1982. I was 48, you were nine months. We were on a flight from JFK to London. Saw you immediately. A baby on a seven-hour flight. The first hour was bliss… then the crying started. Small whimpers at first, then came the shrieking. Louder. LOUDER. LOUDER! Till it filled the whole cabin. When I arrived in London, I was a shell of a man. Broken. You see, I had spent my entire life savings to go to London to see my beloved Buckingham Palace, so I could see if I could make those soldiers laugh. Because of you, I was too tired to do anything funny. And I vowed from that day forward that I would devote the rest of my life to getting revenge on you, little baby. 
MAN: What are you saying? 
CREEPY MAN: [CHUCKLES] Airline seats? Seems like a crapshoot. Well, not if you go through someone’s trash. 
MAN: You went through my trash? 
CREEPY MAN: [CHUCKLES WICKEDLY] How do you think I got this? [SHOWS OPEN WOUND ON HAND]
MAN: Oh, my God, what is that?
CREEPY MAN: A rat bit me!
WOMAN: Jesus!
CREEPY MAN: It’s not that gross. And now, here we are… the stars aligned. And now, I will exact my revenge. I’m gonna cry… the whole flight. [EYES OPEN WIDE AS HE STARTS WAILING UNCONTROLLABLY IN MAN’S FACE]
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir? 
CREEPY MAN: [TURNS TO SEE ATTENDANT] What?!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: You’re in this man’s seat. 
CREEPY MAN: No, I’m in my own seat. I’ll show you my ticket right here. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: [POINTING TO BACK OF PLANE] That’s way back there. 
CREEPY MAN: But can’t I stay here? 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: You can’t just sit wherever. 
CREEPY MAN: You can at some concerts. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir, you’re back there. 
CREEPY MAN: [UPSET] Shit! Shit! [STANDS UP] Excuse me. [NEW PASSENGER STANDING IN AISLE] Oh, that’s a good idea, move in the direction of where I’m heading. Dumb piece of shit!

3.1 Which Hand
A magic show opens up a marital rift.
[MAGICIAN ON STAGE MAKES SPARK IN HIS HAND] [LAUGHTER AND CHEERING FROM THE AUDIENCE]
MAGICIAN: Thank you so much. Well, now I’m looking for a volunteer from the audience. [CHARLIE RAISES HAND, BRENDA LOOKS EXCITED AND CLAPS FOR HIM AS HE WALKS ONTO STAGE] What’s your name?
CHARLIE: Charlie. 
MAGICIAN: Charlie, so nice to meet you. 
CHARLIE: You too. 
MAGICIAN: Charlie, we’re gonna do just a quick sobriety test. Can you do that? 
CHARLIE: Yeah. 
MAGICIAN: How many balls do I have in my hand? 
CHARLIE: One. 
MAGICIAN: [REVEALS TWO] These aren’t supposed to be hard yet, Charlie. [CROWD LAUGHS] I’ll slow it down for you. Okay. Charlie, all I want you to do is remember which hand the ball is in. Can you do that? 
CHARLIE: I think so. 
MAGICIAN: He thinks so. Confidence is not your strong suit, neither is your suit-suit. Alright, Charlie, I just want you to focus on which hand the ball is in. [PUTS BALL IN RIGHT HAND]
CHARLIE: Okay. 
MAGICIAN: And I’ll give you a hint, [GESTURES TO LEFT HAND] it’s not this one. 
CHARLIE: [TAPS MAGICIAN’S RIGHT HAND] Right here? 
MAGICIAN: Goddamn it, Charlie. [OPENS RIGHT HAND TO REVEAL NO BALL] You had one job. I’ll give you one last chance. [POINTS TO LEFT HAND] Which hand is it in? 
CHARLIE: [HESITANTLY POINTS TO MAGICIAN’S LEFT HAND] Right here? 
MAGICIAN: No, Charlie, it’s in your pocket. Give him a round of applause. It’s Charlie. [CROWD LAUGHS AND CHEERS] Give it up for him. 
[CHARLIE SITS BACK AT TABLE, BRENDA LOOKS SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED]
MAGICIAN: Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the next trick is something that kept me out of college for… 
[TRANSITION TO CHARLIE AND WIFE DRIVING] 
CHARLIE: That was really fun. [BRENDA SITS SILENTLY] God, I’m so full. If I didn’t have to drive, I would have probably took them up on that offer of the bourbon flight. That’s so cool. [BRENDA SIGHS WEARILY AS SHE GAZES OUT WINDOW] We should do dancing next. 
[TRANSITION TO BEDROOM, BRENDA ALREADY IN BED LAYING AWAY FROM DOOR AS CHARLIE ENTERS] 
CHARLIE: So the babysitter did art with the kids. That’s cool. [CHUCKLES AS HE GETS INTO BED] Such a fun night. Goodnight, sweetie. I love you. [CHARLIE TURNS OFF LAMP AND LAYS DOWN]
BRENDA: [QUIETLY] Why the fuck didn’t you stick up for yourself? 
CHARLIE: What? 
BRENDA: Why the fuck didn’t you stick up for yourself, you fucking coward? 
CHARLIE: [SITS UP AND TURNS ON LAMP] What are you talking about? 
BRENDA: [ROLLS OVER TO FACE CHARLIE, MORE AGGRESSIVELY] The magician, Charlie. He embarrassed you. 
CHARLIE: What? 
BRENDA: [DISGUSTED] He brought you up on stage, and he insulted your intelligence. He made fun of how you look, and you did nothing. 
CHARLIE: [CHUCKLES] No, he was just joking around. He was a funny magician. 
BRENDA: That fat piece of shit made you look like a fool, Charlie. He basically pulled your little dick out in front of everyone and jerked you off until nothing came out, because you are a boy. 
CHARLIE: No, that is not what happened. 
BRENDA: Look… we will stay married and raise the kids until they’re out of the house, but I will not respect you, and I’ll make sure the kids don’t either. 
CHARLIE: [CONCERNED] Oh, my god, it was just a magic act, Brenda. 
BRENDA: [POINTEDLY] You make ten times what he makes. Why didn’t you say that to him? 
CHARLIE: I don’t know if that would’ve helped. 
BRENDA: Right, maybe it wouldn’t have helped. I’m glad you had fun while everyone else had to watch an adult man jerk your little-boy dick off. 
CHARLIE: Jesus Christ. 
[TRANSITION BACK TO COMEDY CLUB, CHARLIE SITS ALONE AT TABLE DEFEATED, APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE]
MAGICIAN: Now… Thank you. Someone–
CHARLIE: [LOUDLY] YEAH! I’ll do it. [WALKS ONTO STAGE]
MAGICIAN: Is that… That’s a familiar face. We don’t usually do that, but welcome him to the stage. [AUDIENCE CLAPS] Hello. How are you? Terrific. 
CHARLIE: I don’t have a boy dick. 
MAGICIAN: Okay. Okay, that’s fine. Uh…
CHARLIE: [OUT TO AUDIENCE] I make ten times as much as you. 
MAGICIAN: Well, you wouldn’t know it from the suit. [LAUGHTER FROM AUDIENCE]
CHARLIE: [SCREAMING] YOU RUINED MY FUCKING LIFE! [LUNGES AT MAGICIAN]

OLD MAN: A good steering wheel that doesn’t fly off your hand while you’re driving. [PAUSE]
PAUL: Uh, automatic side-view mirrors. 
OLD MAN: A great steering wheel that doesn’t whiff out of the window while I drive. That is a good idea. 
LEADER: Yeah, I wrote it down. 
OLD MAN: Oh, nice. 
LEADER: Okay, what do we think it should look like? 
PAUL: Sleek. 
LEADER: Good. 
WOMAN: High-tech. 
GUY: Aerodynamic. 
OLD MAN: Too small. 
LEADER: I’m sorry? 
OLD MAN: Too small. So when you get in there, you’re like, “If the steering wheel fly off, I’m toast.”
LEADER: Look, I– Okay, I don’t know why we’d make it too small. 
OLD MAN: I think it’s a good idea, and I stand by it. 
LEADER: Okay. 
PAUL: And you can have, like, a sporty look. 
LEADER: Great!
OLD MAN: [POINTING AT PAUL] Teacher’s pet. 
LEADER: Uh, any other ideas? 
OLD MAN: Stinky! [WAVES HAND OVER NOSE]
LEADER: What?
OLD MAN: What about if it is stinking inside? 
LEADER: Sorry, you want that in a car? 
OLD MAN: I’m sorry. I cannot think any good car idea because this guy [GESTURES TO PAUL] keeps farting. 
LEADER: Okay, let’s just try and focus on the car. What are some ways we can make it family-friendly?
OLD MAN: No space for mother-in-law. 
PAUL: That’s not helpful. 
OLD MAN: Shut up, Paul. You probably love your mother-in-law. 
PAUL: I actually do. 
OLD MAN: Oh, my God, he admit it! [GROUP CHUCKLES] Paul?
PAUL: What?
OLD MAN: Paul?
PAUL: What? 
OLD MAN: [WHISPERS] You have… no… good… car… ideas. 
PAUL: Shut up. 
OLD MAN: I doing the best at this. 
LEADER: Alright, maybe we should lay off Paul. 
WOMAN: That’s what his wife said. [GROUP LAUGHS]
OLD MAN: Okay, this car is everything! [FLIPS WATER BOTTLE] [GROUP CELEBRATES] You flinched, Paul! Now you have to marry your mother-in-law!
LEADER: [EXCITEDLY] Yeah, because he landed it and you flinched, you have to marry your mother-in-law!
PAUL: I did not flinch. 
OLD MAN: You have to! You have to, Paul. 
GUY: Marry your mother-in-law. 
PAUL: I didn’t flinch. 
WOMAN: Come on, Paul. 
OLD MAN: If you don’t, that mean you yourself admit it yourself that you suck. 
LEADER: That’s true. You flinched with the bottle, Paul.
OLD MAN: Who is the most popular now, Paul? 
LEADER: Paul, you have to marry your mother-in-law if you flinched at the bottle! [OLD MAN DABS, THEN FLIPS BOTTLE AGAIN] [GROUP CHEERS]
OLD MAN: Paul, you flinch!

HOWIE: Your, uh, record collection’s very meat and potatoes, Liz.

LIZ: Okay, everyone get a celebrity name in? Alright, Team One, you’re up.

HOWIE: He played the alto sax with the kink in it. 
MAN #1: I don’t know.

MAN #1: Is this another jazz guy?
HOWIE: Laura, you know this. 
LAURA: I need another hint. 
HOWIE: I told you this guy’s whole life story that night we had dinner. I took you to Chartreuse. It was the same dinner that you said you don’t like any PDA. I tried to give you those little kisses, and you said no PDA. Remember? I criticized you for being addicted to your phone, and tried to make it up to you by buying the entire dessert menu, [TALKING TO ROOM] and she didn’t even take a bite? 
LIZ: Time. 
HOWIE: Come on, guys! We didn’t get one. 
WOMAN #1: That’s because they’re supposed to be celebrities everyone knows. 
HOWIE: [GROANS AS HE SITS BACK DOWN] Oh, you mean like household names like Roy Donk, or Jack Marshall who wrote The Munsters’ theme song?
MAN #1: [CONFUSED] Roy Donk?

LIZ: [WEARILY] Yes, you can have some gazpacho soup. 
HOWIE: Alright, let’s get back into it. [GROANS AS HE STANDS] Oooookay. It’s my turn. My, my turn. Okay, let’s see. Oh, well, he was a frequent guest on The Colgate Comedy Hour. The radio program. Come on.
LAURA: I don’t know what The Colgate Hour is. 
HOWIE: Okay, pass. Okay. I don’t know if this is gonna help you out at all, but he was also a frequent guest on The Colgate Comedy Hour. He did panels with Paul Julian, the guy who did the voice of the Road Runner. “Beep-beep.” Don’t you remember how we listened to his whole album that one night I told you you’d never be a good writer ‘cause you don’t have a curious mind?
MAN #2: Time. 
HOWIE: Ah, damn it. 
MAN #1: Who was it? 
HOWIE: [EXASPERATED] Paul Bufano. duh! Paul Bufano, how hard is that? Paul Bufano! Come on. Jeez! You don’t remember that night we listened to the whole album Cafeteria Jangle? It’s the night you gave me that Fitbit and I said I would get wrist cancer from it. You said, “It’s the cigars you smoke that’s gonna give you cancer. It’s the T-bone steaks you eat that are gonna give you cancer.” You don’t remember that?
LAURA: Just have some gazpacho, Howie.
HOWIE: Oh, my gazpacho soup is here. [TAKES A SPOONFUL, EXCLAIMS] This gazpacho soup just burned my lips!
LIZ: The gazpacho?
HOWIE: Yeah, it’s been sitting out. It warmed up. 
LIZ: It warmed up so much that it burned your lip?
HOWIE: Let me explain something to you. If you’re expecting something ice cold, and you bring it up to your lips and it’s room temp, it’s going to feel like your mouth’s on fire. It’s gonna feel like your body’s on fire.
MAN #1: No way, man. 
HOWIE: You know what? I’m bored. This party’s officially boring. I’m bored, and you people are very rude. [TO LAURA] Listen, let’s get out of here. Alright? My buddy Ray, his parents are out of town. He’s gonna let us use his basement for “if you know what I mean.”
LAURA: You guys really embarrassed me in front of Howie. 
Season 01, Episode 04: Oh Crap, A Bunch More Bad Stuff Just Happened
4.1 Lifetime Achievement Award
A service dog gets super friendly.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, the president of the Marjorie Caldwell Society of Arts and Music, John Ballgram.
JOHN: Good evening. Tonight, we honor the life and the music of Mr. Herbie Hancock, and if we’re lucky, we might even get him to come up here and play a little music for us. But first, I do want to say, just for anyone who’s concerned… I don’t think the dog that bit me should get put down.I know that’s protocol when a person falls and a dog bites them, the dog gets put down… but I don’t think the dog should get put down, because I know that’s a service dog. Otherwise, why would it be allowed in here, and 
 Okay, I just wanted to say that so it didn’t cloud the rest of the evening. 
The year is 1957, on the mean streets of Chicago–
WOMAN: My dog didn’t bite you. [MURMURING]
JOHN: What? 
WOMAN: My dog didn’t try to bite you. 
JOHN: It didn’t what? 
WOMAN: It was trying to hump your head. [LAUGHTER FROM CROWD]
JOHN: It tried to bite me, ma’am. It tried to bite the back of my hair off. 
WOMAN: It was humping you, dude. 
JOHN: Uh… Okay. Herbie can play. Herbie can compose. Herbie sees music in a… I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but, uh… What do you even have? 
WOMAN: What? 
JOHN: What do you even have that you have a service dog that’s allowed in here? 
WOMAN: That’s really none of your business. 
JOHN: That would be true if your dog didn’t try to bite the back of my hair off. 
MAN: You know what happened. 
JOHN: I-I don’t, and it’s too bad we can’t figure it out ‘cause nobody has video or anything. 
MAN #2: I took a video. [CROWD MURMURS]
JOHN: Oh… fine. There’s no way to watch it. 
HERBIE: Tech guy can plug it in right there. [APPLAUSE]
JOHN: Thanks, Herbie. [TECH GUY PLUGS IN PHONE] Cool, alright. [VIDEO PLAYS] Okay, here I am. Here I am. I’m walking up the stage. [JOHN TRIPS IN VIDEO] There, I trip a little on the stair. And here comes a dog trying to bite me. [LAUGHTER FROM CROWD AS VIDEO SHOWS DOG HUMPING THE BACK OF JOHN’S NECK] It’s… It’s trying to bite me! It’s trying to rip my hair out. What are you laughing at? Oh. my God. Are you saying that your dog has blue balls now? You said it humped me. Well, it certainly didn’t finish, ‘cause look. [TURNS AROUND TO SHOW NECK, AUDIENCE GROANS IN DISGUST] It’s dry. And you know what? You don’t tape people. What is this society, that we tape everything? What’s going on? Do we not live in the moment anymore? We just tape everything from a phone? I don’t like that. You know, that’s what Herbie’s music is against. 
HERBIE: I don’t know, man. I think the dog humped you. 
JOHN: That’s why I love Herbie Hancock, he loves to lie. [BAND INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC AS WE WATCH DOG CONTINUE TO HUMP JOHN’S NECK]
4.2 Christmas Carol
Ebenezer Scrooge and Ghost of Christmas way-future.
Before “Lifetime Achievement Award”
[A MAN IN A ROBOTIC SUIT IS FIGHTING A BATTLE IN A FIERY LAND] [YELLING AGRESSIVELY] Oh, crap. There’s only one man who can save us now. I better get going before it’s too late. [SCREAMS AND RUNS] 
Continuing after “Lifetime Achievement Award”
VOICEOVER: We now return to the Channel 20 Christmas classic, The Night Scrooge Saved Christmas. 
SCROOGE: [HOPEFUL MUSIC] Oh, it’s Christmas!
FUTURE MAN: [BREAKING THROUGH WALL] Scrooge!
SCROOGE: Who are you?
FUTURE MAN: I am the Ghost of Christmas Way Future.
SCROOGE: I already met the Ghost of Christmas Future. 
FUTURE MAN: I said Way Future, Scrooge!
SCROOGE: What are you here to show me? 
FUTURE MAN: Christmas in the year 3050. Skeletrex and his Bone Brigade have enslaved the human race, and we need your help.
SCROOGE: What are you talking about? 
FUTURE MAN: Bonies are slaughtering humans by the millions, taking their bones and using them to make more bone soldiers, and, more important, fleets of bone cars. 
SCROOGE: What–
FUTURE MAN: Frigging Bonies! But I’ve got a plan. We’ve got to kill Skeletrex. He’s huge! He’s 15 feet tall and has the bones the size of tree trunks. 
SCROOGE: What–
FUTURE MAN: Oh yeah, I almost forgot! He carries a club made of lava. Damn you, Skeletrex! [GUN FIRES] [SKELETON COMES THROUGH WALL PORTAL] Oh, crap! One of the Bonies made it through the Christmas portal. Quick, Scrooge, bash him with your cane. [SCROOGE BEATS SKELETON, SKELETON MELTS INTO GOOP] That’s it, Scrooge. Now, go ahead and eat that goop, Scrooge. It’ll give you the Bonie’s sense of humor. [NEW SKELETON EMERGES FROM GOOP] Oh, watch out, Scrooge! It’s a bone larva. Don’t let it lay an egg!
SCROOGE: I don’t know what to do!
FUTURE MAN: Use your Christmas cheer and bash it’s fricking brains out, you idiot! [SCROOGE HITS SKELETON] Yeah! Bash that bone larva. Attaboy! That’s good bone-crushing. 
SCROOGE: [KILLS SKELETON] I think I’m beginning to get the hang of this. 
FUTURE MAN: Scrooge, you cheap bastard, you’re a genius at this. Oh, crap! The Bone Brigade is doing a bunch more bad stuff! We’re gonna have to go to the future. Crap dang it, this sucks!
4.3 Nachos
WOMAN: So, do you like it out here? 
MAN: You know, coming from the Midwest I was unsure whether I’d like California or not. 
WOMAN: Yeah. 
MAN: But I gotta say, I love it. [WOMAN TAKES BITE OF SHARED NACHOS] You know, the weather, obviously. 
WOMAN: Mm-hm. 
MAN: It doesn’t get any better. [WOMAN GRABS FOR FULLY LOADED NACHO, MAN NOTICES] And you think I’d miss the seasons… But you know what? Sometimes I do, but most of the time, I don’t. [WOMAN CHUCKLES] You excuse me for a second? 
WOMAN: Mm-hm. 
[MAN LEAVES TABLE AND GOES TO TALK TO SERVER]
MAN: Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second? 
SERVER: How can I help you? 
MAN: My date’s eating all the fully loaded nachos. All the ones with all the meat, cheese, and everything, the ones that are fully loaded, she’s hogging them, so I’m mostly getting just, like, just chips. Like mostly just chips, like nothin’ on ‘em, but, like, a little bit of cheese and maybe one little nugget of meat. 
SERVER: Okay. 
MAN: Can you say something to her?
SERVER: Say what? 
MAN: Maybe go up to the table and just say, like, “Hey, stop that.” Or, like, “Hey, that’s not allowed.”
SERVER: You want me to go over and say, “Stop eating the meat on the chips’?
MAN: No, just say the restaurant has a rule. It’s not you, it’s a rule the restaurant has that if you get an item to share, you can’t… When eating fully loaded nachos, one person can’t just eat all the fully loaded ones. Like, don’t look around, find the one with the most meat, and always eat that one. 
SERVER: Can’t you just ask her to share with you?
MAN: Can’t you just say the restaurant has a rule? 
[CUT BACK TO MAN SITTING BACK AT TABLE ON DATE]
WOMAN: I don’t know. Maybe it’s just me but like, “Play your hits, Like, don’t play the new stuff.”
MAN: Yeah, I totally agree. You go to a concert, and you want to hear the songs you love. 
WOMAN: Right, exactly, like–
MAN: Give me the good-time rock’n’roll. 
WOMAN: I want to sing along! Ya know? [GIGGLES]
MAN: Totally! [BOTH LAUGHING]
WOMAN: This is really fun. 
MAN: This is so fun. 
WOMAN: I’m glad we did this. 
SERVER: Are you enjoying everything? 
WOMAN: [HOLDING FULLY LOADED NACHO] Yeah, everything’s great. 
MAN: Yeah. 
SERVER: Uh… okay. Because we have a rule here that if you order nachos to share… uh, one person can’t just eat all the fully loaded nachos. 
MAN: [PRETENDING TO ACT SURPRISED] What’s that? Say that again? 
SERVER: We have a rule that basically says if two people order nachos to share… one person can’t take the ones with meat and stuff. 
MAN: What? I’ve never heard anything like that before. That is… so weird. But I guess if that’s a rule, thanks. 
SERVER: Okay. [STARTS TO WALK AWAY]
WOMAN: Hang on a second. [TO DATE] Did you ask him to come over here and say that? 
MAN: [QUIETLY] … What?
WOMAN: Did you ask him to say that? 
MAN: [DISTRAUGHT] What the hell are you talking about? 
WOMAN: You got up, you talked to him [GESTURES TO SERVER] for a long time, and then the minute you sit down, he comes over and says that the restaurant has this rule. No restaurant has a rule about who gets to eat what. 
MAN: [SHOCKED, QUIETLY] … What?! [EMOTIONAL VOICE] I went up there to ask if we could switch tables. There’s an air conditioner above this table and I was worried you were gonna get cold. 
WOMAN: There’s no vent above us. 
MAN: What?!
WOMAN: Did he ask you to come over and say that about the nachos? 
SERVER: He did. 
MAN: [BETRAYED] What? [EMOTIONAL] went up there to complain about the rule. 
WOMAN: You just learned the rule!
MAN: What?! 
WOMAN: He just came over here…
MAN: Who?!
WOMAN: [GESTURES TO SERVER] Him! 
MAN: What is going on?!
WOMAN: [TO SERVER] We’ll take the check. 
MAN: We’re gonna be so early for that movie. 
WOMAN: I’m not going to the movie.

MAN #1: [YELLING] I don’t know why I got the fucking sticker, man! [CALMING DOWN] I grew up in a small town. Things were hard. We needed to make little jokes. I learned to make my car a little funny. I’m sorry if I sent the wrong message, like I was some sort of representative or something. 
FRENZIED MAN: … So you don’t have pornos and calendars?

A hot dog-shaped car crash.
[TIRES SHRIEKING, HOTDOG SHAPED CAR CRASHES INTO STOREFRONT]
MANAGER: Is everyone okay? 
WOMAN #1: What happened? Did anyone see? 
MANAGER: Someone drove a hot-dog-shaped car through the window! 
MAN #1: The driver’s gone!
MAN #2: Somebody call the cops. We need to find that driver. 
WOMAN #1: They could have killed someone. 
MANAGER: Whose car is this? 
HOTDOG MAN: [DRESSED AS A HOTDOG] Yeah, come on! Whoever did this, just confess. We promise we won’t be mad. 
MANAGER: What? 
HOTDOG MAN: We’ll close our eyes, just take your car and get out of here. 
WOMAN #1: 	Sir, that is clearly your car. 
HOTDOG MAN: Wrong. 
MANAGER: Someone call the police!
HOTDOG MAN: Yeah, that’s one idea. Or, we could work as a team, find out whoever did this, and punish him ourselves. Maybe take his bare butt out of his costume and spank him. Maybe you could do it, sir. 
MAN #2: Not gonna happen. 
HOTDOG MAN: Okayyy, youuu. [GESTURES TO WOMAN]
WOMAN #1: No. 
MAN #1: Well, one of us is gonna have to do it. 
MANAGER: No one’s getting spanked. 
HOTDOG MAN: [SIGHS] You know what’s driving me nuts? It could literally be any one of us. Ooooh!
MAN #2: No, it couldn’t. You’re dressed like a hotdog. 
HOTDOG MAN: So is that guy. [POINTS TO DONALD WEARING SUIT AND TIE IN THE COLOURS OF A HOTDOG WITH MUSTARD]
DONALD: Oh, no. 
MANAGER: Donald might look like a hotdog, but you’re wearing an actual hotdog costume. 
HOTDOG MAN: You know, I don’t have to sit here and be insulted like this. I’m just going to take as many suits as I can grab, get in that random hotdog car…♪ Random ♪ … and drive back to Wiener Hall.
OFFICER: Oh, my God. What happened here? 
HOTDOG MAN: Yeah. We’re all trying to find the guy who did this and give him a spanking. 
OFFICER: It’s obviously this guy, right? 
MANAGER: Yes. 
HOTDOG MAN: I have a name. 
MANAGER: What’s your name?
HOTDOG MAN: [SIGHS] Perfect. We’ve been sitting here talking all day, and you all never bothered to learn my name. [CHUCKLES] We’re so… buried in our phones. [STARTS PICKING UP CLOTHING FROM TABLES AND RACKS] Instead of giving someone a real smile, we send an emoji. [SCOFFS] I mean, we don’t even… look at porn on our computer anymore. We look at it on our phone? Pornhub, XTube… I know these names better than I know my own grandmother’s. YouPorn, XXN, RedTube… panty jobs, homegrown Simpsons stuff. All great, but I ask you this: If I was a big ol’ guy with a big burly white beard, would you still be yelling at me? Or would you be spanking my bare butt, balls, and back? Think about that for one second. [STUFFS CLOTHES INTO THE HOTDOG CAR] I guess if nobody wants this car, I’ll take it.

HOTDOG MAN: Yeah, right, you piece of dog shit! [RUNS AWAY AS OFFICERS CHASE HIM, GIVING THEM THE FINGER] You’re fucking dog shit!

A co-worker latches on to an expression.
DENNIS: Woah, is this the new copier? 
STEVE: It sure is, Dennis. They installed it this morning. 
WOMAN: I can’t believe Corporate actually listened to our request. 
STEVE: Yep, I guess Christmas came early this year. [ALL LAUGH] This thing rules. It collates, staples pages. No more stapling by hand. 
TRACEY: Yeah, Santa should have wrapped it. 
MEGAN: What? 
TRACEY: The printer. Santa should have wrapped it when he gave it early. 
MEGAN: Oh. This is going to make our lives so much easier. 
DENNIS: I know. This is so much nicer than the old copier. 
TRACEY: Yeah, I know. And Santa and all his elves must have worked so hard on it, and then they gave it to us early. 
STEVE: It’s a very nice printer, Tracey. Just make sure no one copies their rear-end. [ALL LAUGH]
TRACEY: [IN HUSKY VOICE] Oh, that naughty old elf must be one mean bastard to give us this so early. 
MEGAN: What? 
TRACEY: [IN REGULAR VOICE] Did I stutter, Megan? Santa Claus–
STEVE: Okay, it looks like the printer has gotten everyone a little too excited. 
TRACEY: Of course it did. Santa himself brought this here early, with Rudolf, and now it’s causing a fight. 
STEVE: It was just an expression. 
TRACEY: [SHARPLY] I know that. I’m not stupid. I’m smarter than you! 
STEVE: Everyone just go back to work. 
TRACEY: Are we even going to get anything now? 
WOMAN: What? 
TRACEY: ‘Cause I didn’t ask for that. [SLOWLY] Does that count as what I get for Christmas as my gift? Steve makes one Christmas joke, and you all shit yourself laughing. It’s the talk of the office? But I make hundreds… of on par, if not better, and everyone ices me? [UPSET] I’m not popular at all!

An excuse for tardiness spirals out of control.
ALAN: [WALKING INTO HOUSE PARTY]  Parents’ night out. I can’t wait to see everyone here. 
PARTNER: Yeah, especially Barry. We don’t hang out as much anymore, but I really like him. 
ALAN: Hey, we’re a little late. If anyone asks, let’s just say the babysitter was late. 
PARTNER: Oh, that’s a great idea. 
ALAN: [WALKING UP TO GROUP] Hey, everyone. Sorry we’re late. 
PARTNER: Yeah, fucking babysitter. Absolutely fucked us. I fucking hate her. Such an idiot. 
ALAN: It wasn’t that bad. 
BARRY: I hope she had a good excuse. 
ALAN: She did, yeah. 
WOMAN: Alan! [BECKONS HIM OVER]
PARTNER: Yeah. Yeah, she did. Yeah, it was just… It was, like, a hit-and-run. 
BARRY: Oh, my God. Should we call the cops? 
PARTNER: Yeah, no, like, we did, but it’s okay, ‘cause the cops said that, like, the people she hit are just kind of like nothing, so it’s fine. 
BARRY: What do you mean, the people were just kind of nothing? 
PARTNER: They’re just, like, not important, like, they don’t matter. Like, there’s, like, no records of ‘em. 
BARRY: So, like, they’re homeless? 
PARTNER: No, they’re just, like, nothing. Like, they’re not even supposed to be around in the area. Bottom line is, no one’s gonna get in trouble, nobody should feel sad at all. The cops were just like, “Oh, yeah, this is fine. Don’t worry about it at all.” The cops aren’t even gonna, like, follow up on it because, like, the people are, like, already dead. 
BARRY: Oh, my God. They’re dead?
PARTNER: Yeah. Yeah, they’re dead. Barry, can I talk to you for a second? 
BARRY: Sure. [THE TWO OF THEM STEP ASIDE]
PARTNER: If you keep talking about the hit-and-run, I’m gonna fucking kill you. 
BARRY: A hit-and-run is a felony. 
PARTNER: It’s not a problem! The cops came, they said it’s fine. They’re not, like, real people, kinda. 
BARRY: The cops said that 
PARTNER: If you keep asking me questions, I’m gonna beat the crap out of you. 
BARRY: What? Really?
PARTNER: No. I mean, yeah. I’m gonna beat the crap out of you.
BARRY: Because I was asking questions?
PARTNER: [GROANS] I’m gonna embarrass you at this party, Barry. 
BARRY: What? 
PARTNER: I’m gonna embarrass you, Barry. It’s done. Get ready to be embarrassed.

MAN: I’d like to get off now. I’m not having any fun. 
WOMAN: [SCOFFS] Then we wasted our money. 
TED: Sound familiar? It’s a beautiful fall day, and you’re riding with a loved one, when all of a sudden, you’re made to feel less of a man. You can’t compete with these horse hogs. 
EMILY: And now you don’t need to. Here at Fenton’s Stables and Horse Ranch, we guarantee our horses have a smaller penis than a human man. 
THEME SONG: 
♪ Fenton’s Stables and Horse Ranch ♪
♪ Where the horses are hung like you ♪
TED: Meet Starry Night here. At first glance, he appears to be a normal horse. But check his undercarriage, and he’s the same size as you and I. Is it easy to find a horse with a short peanut like this? No, it’s damn near impossible.
EMILY: That’s why our ancestors started breeding out the big penis gene in our horses generations ago.
TED: In fact, this year, we were excited to welcome our first five-inch horse penis. Tragically, he passed early this year.
EMILY: Killed himself. 
TED: Yeah, he jumped off a cliff. 
[CUT BACK TO COUPLE ON HORSES]
WOMAN: Ha! Is that what they mean by “hung like a horse”? 
MAN: I guess.

JESSE: The second one, yeah, right there. 
WEATHERMAN: And with a cold front moving in from the northeast, it’s going– Shit. [ALL LAUGHING]
MAN: He, like, had to have gotten fired, right? 
JESSE: Have you seen the one with the kid who puts the glow stick in the microwave? 
MAN: The dad is so funny. 
JESSE: So funny, right? 
REGGIE: He’s fucking nuts. 
WOMAN #2: Reggie, what’s your favourite? 
REGGIE: Uh, I don’t know what my favourite is. 
WOMAN #2: Well, what’s a funny one?
REGGIE: Oh, God, there’s like… tons I can think of that just blow me away. 
MAN: It’s fine if you, like, don’t have one. 
REGGIE: I have one. We all have one. I have one. I just can’t remember exactly how you type it in. 
WOMAN #2: Well, I can search for it. What happens in it? 
REGGIE: It’s so funny. I just can’t remember, like… how to search for it. [PAUSE]
WOMAN #2: Well, just let us know when you remember it. 
REGGIE: I just can’t remember. I can’t remember how to search it. What… [STARES AROUND CONFUSED]
JESSE: Uh, you know what we have to watch? We have to watch the guy with the newscaster on the roller coaster. 
MAN: Yes, so funny. 
JESSE: It’s so funny. 
[EVERYONE COLLECTIVELY CHATTERING ABOUT IT BEING SO FUNNY] [REGGIE LOOKS DISTRESSED AS HE FAKES A SMILE AND A LAUGH, A TEAR ROLLS DOWN HIS CHEEK]
Scene continues after “Baby Shower”
WOMAN #2: She said she’s gonna be another 15 minutes. 
MAN: Okay, so, what are we watching? 
JESSE: Okay, I just saw this new video. It’s called Wine Stomp Lady. 
WOMAN #2: I saw that. I don’t want to wreck it, but why is she even up there? 
REGGIE: I have one. 
WOMAN #2: Oh, nice, Reggie. What is it?
REGGIE: Have you guys ever seen Bozo Dubbed Over?
MAN: Like Bozo the Clown? 
REGGIE: Have you seen it? It’s hilarious. 
WOMAN #2: No, let’s watch it. 
REGGIE: Type in “Bozo Dubbed Over” and there’s spaces between each of the words. [SEARCH REVEALS ONLY 1 VIDEO]
WOMAN #2: Is this it? 
REGGIE: [SQUINTS] Yes. 
WOMAN #2: It has one view, and it says it was uploaded at 6:00 a.m. this morning. 
REGGIE: Have you seen it? It’s hilarious. [WOMAN #2 HITS PLAY]
VIDEO: Oh, fuck. What the fuck? I’m not even supposed to be here. I hope I don’t jack off. 
WOMAN #2: What is this, Reggie? 
REGGIE: I guess it’s, like, a viral video where Bozo dubs over. 
VIDEO: Oh, fuck, a clownputer? Fuck that. Probably got no games. I hope nobody goes home and fucks my mom. 
REGGIE: Hilarious, right? 
VIDEO: What the fuck’s that? Like, a little circle? Oh, fuck! I thought this guy’s supposed to be bald!
MAN: What is this guy trying to do? Is this supposed to be what Bozo’s thinking or saying? 
REGGIE: What guy? It’s Bozo. Bozo did it. 
MAN: Bozo did… what? 
REGGIE: Bozo did the dub. He’s doing the dub. Bozo is, not a guy. 
VIDEO: Um, okay. This guy’s about to jack off. 
WOMAN #2: I feel like it makes more sense that a different guy is dubbing over it. 
REGGIE: No, he’s saying what he wanted to say on the show now. Bozo is. That’s Bozo’s voice. 
VIDEO: This little fucking bike’s a piece of shit. 
WOMAN #2: Reggie, did you make this thing last night so you’d have a video to show? [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYS, REGGIE STARES WIDE-EYED]
REGGIE: [INTERNALLY] No. 
6.4 Baby Shower
Baby shower planning gets heated.
WOMAN: Okay, so I talked to Marcus and he’s gonna take care of catering for the whole thing. So, we’re gonna have hors d’oeuvres, and then mini pizzas, shared salads, and, of course, little cupcakes with baby Debbie’s name written on them. 
WOMAN #2: That’s perfect. Christine is gonna love that. This is gonna be such a nice baby shower!
WOMAN #3: Oh, we should do, like, a little gift bag for everybody. 
MAN #1: That’s a great idea. 
WOMAN #2: How much do we want to spend? 
WOMAN #3: I think maybe around $200 makes sense. Oh, maybe we could give everybody little individual bottles of champagne. 
WOMAN: Oh, that’s a good idea. People also love those macarons. You know? So good. 
MAN #2: Yeah, what about Stanzo brand fedoras? 
WOMAN #3: What? 
MAN #2: Stanzo brand fedoras in each of the gift bags. They’re Stanzos, they’re nice. 
WOMAN: I mean, I don’t know about fedoras for a baby shower, though. 
MAN #2: For $200, I could probably get 50 Stanzo brand fedoras. 
WOMAN #3: Yeah, I don’t think we’re gonna do the fedoras. 
MAN: You know what’s cute that I saw on Etsy? Little baby-toed flip flops. 
WOMAN #2:  Or, what about, like, a little candle? 
WOMAN #3:  Oh, that’s cool! 
MAN #2: Or what about a thousand plastic meatballs? 
WOMAN #3: To put in the gift bags? 
MAN #2: Yeah. They don’t go bad or stink or nothin’. For $200, I could probably get a thousand plastic meatballs. 
WOMAN #3: Maybe we should keep thinking. 
MAN: Oh, I know. What about, like, one of those little things with soaps and lotions from Bath & Body Works? 
WOMAN: Oh, I like that. 
MAN #2: You know what I saw once I thought was cute? Tommy guns. 
WOMAN #2: My friends aren’t gonna buy the crap from your mob movie. 
MAN #2: What mob movie? It fell apart ‘cause it fucking sucked. 
WOMAN #2: Goddamn it. 
MAN #2: You brought it up. 
WOMAN #2: No, I didn’t. I didn’t even know you still had that stuff. 
MAN #2: Where would it be?! Nobody wants a thousand plastic meatballs! They don’t even look real! They look like little pieces of shit! 
WOMAN #2: You just said they look real!
MAN #2: To them. I need to unload them. 
WOMAN #2: These are my friends. 
MAN #2: [TO GROUP] They– They look real. They don’t look like little pieces of shit. 
WOMAN: We’re not doing the meatballs. 
MAN #2: You’re blowing it. 
WOMAN: We’re going to do the candles. We’re gonna do individual little bottles of champagne. And then I think if we have any money left over we should do–
MAN #2: Fifty black slicked-back-hair wigs. 
WOMAN #3: What are you saying? 
MAN #2: Fifty black slicked-back-hair wigs. Fifty black slicked-back-hair wigs. 
MAN: How much money did you put into this? 
MAN #2: I thought it was gonna be a hit! It turns out it fucking sucks! 
WOMAN #3: [SYMPATHETIC] Maybe we could buy a few fedoras. 
MAN #2: [CALMING DOWN] Its… It’s gotta… You kinda gotta buy ‘em in bulk, otherwise it’s not worth it for me. 
WOMAN #3: So we have to buy all 50 of them? 
MAN #2: It needs to be quality on my end, otherwise no fucking deal. 
[CUT TO BABY SHOWER, EVERYONE IS OPENING GIFT BAGS TO REVEAL STANZO FEDORAS]
WOMAN: [DISGUSTED] Oh, my God, these stink!
MAN #2: They’re Stanzos. They’re nice. [GUY IN BACKGROUND PUTS ON BLACK SLICKED-BACK-HAIR WIG] [AS MOB MOVIE CHARACTER] Hey! Who took my cigars? [SLOW-MO, BLACK AND WHITE] Who took my cigars? 
[GUY WITH WIG ON FINGER-MACHINE-GUNS, TOMMY GUN SOUND IN BACKGROUND]
6.5 Party House
A weird place to hold an intervention.
Before “Fenton’s Stable and Horse Ranch’
[OLD MAN OUTSIDE OF HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH SHOVEL]
OLD MAN: I want my treasure chest. I want my treasure chest. I want it and I’m gonna get it. [BANGS ON WINDOW] Where’s my treasure chest? Come out. I want my treasure chest. Let me in. This is where I used to live. Is anybody in there? I want my treasure chest. I want it!
After “Baby Shower”
JAKE: I thought Mark was doing better. 
DAWN: Well, last night, Mark fell down and nearly hit his head on the counter. His drinking has really gotten out of control. 
PAT: It’s hard, I know. But it we’re actually his friends, we have to do this intervention. 
JAKE: I could do Friday. 
DAWN: That works for me. 
PAT: We could do it at my house. 
WOMAN: [SLAMS TRUNK OF CAR] We could do it at my house. It’s the most comfortable, it can fit everyone. It’s the perfect trap. Plus, it’s already like a party house, so he’ll want to go there. 
JAKE: Isn’t your house kinda far away? 
WOMAN: Yeah, but it’s like a complete party house. And bring snacks so it feels like a real party. Dawn - chips, Pat - pop, and Jake, why don’t you cook something simple like a hot dip or something. 
JAKE: A hot dip? 
WOMAN: A hot dip or something. Yeah, bring it to my house. It’s settled then. Friday. Let’s bust the fucker. [LAUGHS]
[NIGHTTIME, EVERYONE ENTERING WOMAN’S HOME IN THE DARK] 
WOMAN: [SIGHS] Come on in. Watch your step. There’s a lot of stuff around ‘cause it’s a big party house, so… [FLICKS ON LIGHTS TO REVEAL THE ENTIRE HOUSE IS GARFIELD THEMED]
MARK: Whoa.
DAWN: What is this place? 
WOMAN: Take a seat, Mark. Sorry, bud, no partying tonight. I’m afraid to say this is your intervention. 
MARK: What the fuck? 
WOMAN: You’re busted, man. 
MARK: No, I mean… What is happening with your house? What the hell is all this stuff? 
JAKE: Yeah, should we do this somewhere else? 
WOMAN: Sit down. We’re not fucking around here. Right, guys? [MARK SITS ON ODIE-SHAPED CHAIR] That chair reclines, by the way. The tongue sticks out. 
JAKE: [READING FROM LETTER] “Mark… you used to be my best friend. We were like brothers, going to the movies together, traveling, playing sports. To see something be in control of you, and see you drinking it all away…
WOMAN: [WHISPERS TO DAWN, REFERENCING HOUSE] All Garfield. 
JAKE: “Do you know how hard that is for me? Brother, I love you, but I can’t watch you do this to yourself anymore. You need help.”
WOMAN: [STANDS] Mark, your drinking has made you a totally different person. You’ve lost your lust for life. I’ll never forget the day that I told you that I bought Jim Davis’ house, the creator of Garfield. You just sat there, stared at me… like I didn’t just tell you I bought Jim Davis’ house… fully furnished! Oh, and I read the e-mail that you wrote when you were drunk. I saw how you said I spent all my money on the Jim Davis house. How I wasted all my money on the Garfield house, and how it’s all I talk about. But you know what you didn’t say? How it came fully furnished. [SITS DOWN]
PAT: [READING FROM LETTER] “Mark, this is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. When you showed up at my house at two in the morning, drunk off your ass, you scared my kids. [CRYING] I’ll never forget–”
WOMAN: And I’ll never forget when I woke up at 3 a.m., and heard pounding on the door. It was Jim Davis. He forgot that he didn’t live here anymore. He came in, he pushed me around. He goes, “Hey, where’s the Garfield treasure chest?” I said, “Dude, back off. I don’t know. I didn’t touch a goddamn thing.” Meanwhile, where are you? Drunk little bitch, you make me sick. 
JAKE: Guys, I just looked it up. Jim Davis never owned this house. 
WOMAN: What the fuck are you talking about? Who lived here then? 
JAKE: The guy who tried to kill Jim Davis. 
WOMAN: So you’re saying I spent, like, three hours in a Garfield-shaped hot tub with a murderer? 
[ALARMS BLARING]
MARK: Oh, my God! It’s the guy who tried to kill Jim Davis! [OLD MAN APPEARS ON STAIRWAY] 
OLD MAN: I’m Garfield. 
PAT: [CRYING] What is going on? 
[SECURITY ALARM CONTINUOUSLY SAYING “I hate Mondays”]
OLD MAN: [LAUGHING, DISTORTED VOICE] Garfield!
